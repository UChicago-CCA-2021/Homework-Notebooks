Why , you can-you can even make a fight out of a proposal of marriage . But you ai n\\'t kiddin \\' me . You try to make out you \\'re hard-boiled ... but you \\'re not really . Why , you \\'ve got a heart as big as anything . - And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fella a girl can depend on . I was in love with you almost the first time we met . Oh , you \\'re fine and decent and tenderhearted . Oh , Eddie . You \\'re just the sweetest guy in all the world . - Okay . - And we can be happy . Lots of people are married and happy . I \\'m sick and tired of It . ... while you stay out till 4 . ? 00 In the morning-I said enough Is enough ! Get out , you pig ! That \\'ll never happen to us . - I should say not . - Well ? - Do you want me to go up with you ? - No . I \\'m not afraid now . I \\'m not afraid of anything now . You know ... it \\'s sort of like not being alone anymore . Yeah . It is like that , ai n\\'t it ? When \\'ll we be married ? In the morning . And I \\'ll take the day off . Say ... I \\'m kind of happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? Oh , Eddie . Good night , kid . Good night , darling . - Eddie . - What ? Husband . Okay . Hey , cab . Hello , Edna . What are you doing here ? Jim come over to my house about an hour ago to see if you were there . He was worried about you , so I came back here with him . I , um - I could n\\'t remember the name of that hospital ... you said you were going to to visit that girl . She must be worse , huh ? Your staying there until almost 4:00 . You mean well , Edna , but that \\'s a lot of hooey . - Where were ya ? - Where do you think , Edna ? - I \\'m gon na get married . - No . So , it \\'s as bad as that , huh ? What do you mean it \\'s as bad as that ? I thought girls brought their fellas around and showed them off first to their families . They do in families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , not that you \\'d have brains enough to know it ... but I \\'ve been a pretty good brother to you , see ? I \\'ve been a father and a mother to ya . I \\'m supporting this house . And you \\'ve got some nerve comin \\' in at 4:00 in the morning ... tellin \\' me that you \\'re gon na get married . Why do you object ? You do n\\'t even know the fella . No , but I \\'m going to . Bring him around . Let him meet your family , like any decent fella would want to do . And after a while , if I think he \\'s all right ... you can marry him . - After a while ? - Oh , that gets a rise out of you , does it ? I thought it would . One of them rush marriages . - What do you mean ? - You know what I mean . - You do n\\'t know that I did anything wrong . - I can put two and two together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can prove that you \\'re not . You tell me that you \\'ll wait , or I \\'ll know that you got ta marry this guy . And if that \\'s the case , I do n\\'t want you in the house . - Now , what do you think about that ? - Where \\'ll I go ? Go back where you come from , you little tramp . And get out now . You wo n\\'t take any clothes with you either . I paid for every rag you got on your back . Go on . Get out . You deserve everything you \\'re gettin \\' . Sure does . A girl brought up under the influence of a fine brother like you got . You \\'ll probably end up in the streets . That \\'s what you got in your mind , ai n\\'t it , Jim ? And I wo n\\'t be sorry for her either . No , I do n\\'t expect you to be sorry for her , Jim . But let her have her clothes . - I paid for \\' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let her find out there ai n\\'t another man who \\'ll treat her as white as her own brother did . Go on . Let her have her clothes . All right . Get \\' em , and get out . Hey , Dot . Hey . - Where you goin \\' ? - With the kid , you big bully . You called her a tramp , did n\\'t ya ? Just because she stayed out until 4:00 in the morning and you suspect where she was . Well , I stayed out until 4:00 in the morning , and you knew where I was . So I got a pretty good idea what you think of me . I \\'ll see you in the cemetery . Go on , Dot . Wake up , Dotty . Wake up . Hello , Floyd . Ma just hollered across the air shaft ... and said that she was makin \\' breakfast for a new bride . Are you a new bride ? Yes , darling . I \\'m going to be today . - What \\'s an old one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Run along and play now . Aw , I wan na see Dotty get out of bed . You get out of here . I wan na see Dotty get out of bed . And at his age . - What time is it ? - Almost 11:00 . - I phoned the store and said we were both sick . - Has Eddie come yet ? - Nope . - He has n\\'t ? - Not yet . - I wonder why he does n\\'t come . - Maybe it \\'s \\' cause he does n\\'t know I \\'m here . - That \\'d be a good reason . He certainly would n\\'t come to see me . Oh , he does n\\'t really dislike you , Edna . No , not dislike . He hates me . And it is n\\'t just an average , everyday , amateur kind of hatred either . I \\'ll bet that guy spends hours practicing hating me . Aw , that \\'s just his way . You know , he \\'s kind of funny . That would be great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gee , Edna , it was swell the way you came through for me last night . - I \\'m awful grateful to ya . - And I \\'m grateful toJim . - He saved my life . - How ? Just suppose he did n\\'t turn out to be a heel last night . I \\'d have been married to him in three months , and after being nicely cemented ... with a wedding ring , the church service and everything ... I \\'d have found out what he really is . Yes , sir . He saved my life- \\' cause they send you to the chair these days for killing your husband . In the name of goodness , what are you doing ? - I \\'m trying something , but it wo n\\'t work . - What wo n\\'t ? I put some black ink in the white milk ... and the white milk turned black . But when I put the white milk in the black ink , the black wo n\\'t turn white . Put that ink away and clean up that mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what time Is It now ? It \\'s a little after 11:00 . - Where \\'d you put my stockings ? - Why , I put \\' em , uh-Is this Mrs . Cook \\'s boardinghouse ? Well , is Mr . Collins there ? Collins . Eddie Collins . He what ? He moved away ? Well-Well , he lived there last night . He moved away this morning ? Well-Well , did he say where he was moving to ?

Schuyler 4-6583 . Schuyler 4-6583 . And hurry it up , deary . There \\'s a fire . Here . Hello ? Hello , Lathrop Radio Shop ? Well , can I speak to Mr . Collins , please ? Eddie Collins . Never mind the wisecracks . He \\'s there , I wan na speak to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Fresh guy trying to flirt with me . He what ? He was fired ? What for ? He said he was fired for robbin \\' the cash register . Well , you \\'re all right then . If he \\'s lost his job , it \\'s a cinch he \\'ll be here to marry ya . I ca n\\'t tell whether the fella was kiddin \\' or not . There he is now . See ? All of your troubles for nothing . Oh , gee , and I \\'m not dressed or anything . Oh , give me those stockings . I do n\\'t wan na subscribe to any magazines . I do n\\'t care if you \\'re working your way through the penitentiary . - Was that him , Edna ? - No . A book agent . Oh . What am I gon na do ? Now , stop worrying . If Eddie is only half the guy I think he is , he wo n\\'t let you down . That \\'s the trouble with us women . If we \\'d only realize that-Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - I \\'m cookin \\' it for ya . - A whole pound of butter . I told you a piece of butter , not a pound of butter . A pound \\'s a piece . I \\'ll go , Edna . Oh , darling , you \\'re driving me crazy . Get out into the hall . You \\'ve done all the damage in here that you can . See if you can ruin the wallpaper . - Shall I do it with a knife ? - Get out of here ! - Was n\\'t him , huh ? - No . A man selling-For goodness \\' sake , take that long face off . This is your wedding day , not your funeral . He \\'ll be here . There \\'s a mistake somewhere . That \\'s all . Yeah , last night- that was the mistake . Do n\\'t be silly . He \\'ll be here . Oh , but I love him so much . Well , you can still love him and have a cup of coffee in your stomach too . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything again . - Fine . Then have a glass of milk . - I do n\\'t want any milk . Oh , come on . Have a glass of milk . It \\'ll do you good . You know , the first thing that you have to learn is-I \\'m getting hysterical . Open the door , Floyd . And if it \\'s a man selling coffins , tell him we \\'ll take two . Who \\'s dead ? Oh , Eddie ! - What \\'s the matter ? - Nothing . Say , listen . You \\'re going to be a married man . The first thing you have to learn is to get accustomed to your wife \\'s tears . I was over to your house , and they said you was n\\'t there . So I took a chance and come here . I called up your house , and your landlady said that you \\'d moved . I got a bigger room across the street . My landlady was sore . That \\'s why she would n\\'t tell you where I went . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing . They were kidding \\' ya . Oh , Eddie , I \\'m so happy . - Okay . - Now maybe you can eat some breakfast . We \\'ll eat downtown . We got ta get goin \\' . Go get your things . Her master \\'s voice . - Do you know how to get there ? - I \\'ll find out . - I \\'ll tell ya . You take the subway to City Hall . - Yeah ? When you get out of the train , you walk straight ahead and turn to the right . There are two exits there . You take the one to the left . Understand ? - Yeah . - Then when you get up on the street ... - you walk straight ahead-- I \\'m gon na take a cab . I \\'ll tell you which cab to take . Hey . Whose wedding is this , yours or mine ? Oh , Edna \\'s just trying to help us , Eddie . You was n\\'t on the other side when they had the war , were ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was wondering how they ever got along without you . I phoned my orders over . Wo n\\'t you come down and see us get married ? No . I hate those things- deaths and funerals and things like that . Oh , gee , Edna . I can never thank you enough for all you \\'ve done for me . Oh , that \\'s all right , kid . I only hope you \\'re gon na be awful happy . If she ai n\\'t , you \\'ll hear from me , you big stiff . Okay . - Good luck . - So long . Good-bye . Oh , darling ! Night , now . - Hello , darling . - Hello . - What \\'s this ? - Oh . Just a couple of hunks of candy . Oh , gee , Eddie . - You know why ? - Sure . Because you love me , do n\\'t ya ?

Aw , gee , it was sweet of you to bring me the candy . And I got news for ya . I found a store . The boss is gon na lend me a hundred bucks ... and with the 650 I got saved up , I can swing the deal . He \\'ll let me have all the radios I want on time . - What do you know about that , huh ? - That \\'ll be swell . Of course , we may have to pinch nickels for a while but ... in the end , it \\'ll all be jake . - Gee whiz , I \\'m a happy guy . - Are you , Eddie ? Yeah . I been thinkin \\' about having my own store for over two years now . And while I ai n\\'t much on tossing \\' this baloney ... and all that mush stuff ... a guy could have a worse wife than you . - Ya little squirt . - Oh , Eddie . - I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hat and coat on , and I \\'ll take you over and show you the place . - Oh , I ca n\\'t now . - Why not ? I \\'m waitin \\' for Edna . She phoned she \\'ll be up in a little while . - Ah , what does she want ? - Well , I wanted to ask her advice about something . - About what ? - About-Well , about the store , see what she thinks of it . Oh , gee . It \\'ll be tough if she do n\\'t like it . Oh , Eddie , that \\'s not a nice thing to say . Here she is . Now , please do n\\'t be mean to her . Come in . - Hello , Dot . - HI , Edna . How \\'s the grouch ? I thought they sent you down to Washington ... so you could tell the president how to run the country . Ooh . They sent the president up to see me . Oh , do n\\'t mind him , Edna . - He \\'s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks it . - He \\'s gon na open his own store soon . - Hmm ! I heard Wanamaker \\'s were going out of business . They probably figured the competition would be too much for \\' em . I \\'m going down to the corner and get a paper . Come on . Sit down . I \\'ve got so much to tell you . - Still in love with him ? - Oh , I \\'m just crazy about him . Edna , I \\'m going to have a baby . Oh , Dot . - I \\'m afraid . - Oh , do n\\'t be silly . - My mother had eight of_\\'em . - Yeah . My mother died having me . Yes , but things are different now . You know , the hospitals are better , and the doctors and things . No girl minds it anymore . - What does Eddie say ? - He does n\\'t know . Well , why do n\\'t you tell him ? Well , his heart \\'s so set on having that store . It \\'ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n\\'t know what to do . Edna , I \\'m so worried . You know , if the store \\'s gon na make Eddie happy , I want him to have it . - Sure . - When I think of what happened to my mother-Unless I had everything of the best- you know , the best doctors and everything-- I \\'d be frightened . - You poor kid . Now listen . This fella you \\'re married to is all right . He \\'s 100 ? /o . I know what \\'s the matter with him . He \\'s one of those sensitive eggs . Of course , he may not like me , but what the heck . Napol ? on had a couple of enemies too . Now you tell Eddie tonight . And if I know anything about men ... he \\'ll be stopping strangers on the street tomorrow , bragging about it . - Do you really think so ? - Oh , sure . All men are alike . They puff themselves up . You \\'d think they \\'d done something . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - He will be . I do n\\'t know though . He \\'s always yelling about living in a tenement ... and what a sin it is to have children if you ca n\\'t afford to give \\' em everything . I do n\\'t think I read anything in the papers about him being born in the White House . He was awful poor . That \\'s why he thinks like that about it . Here he is . Do n\\'t say anything . - You still here ? - No . Dld you get your paper , Eddle ? I got down there , and I did n\\'t have any change . You can get one next week . They \\'ll have a dozen new murders for you by then . Here , let me fix that tie . - It looks like a unbent pretzel . - The tie is-You only wear it . Other people have to look at it . I do n\\'t know how you ever picked this jane out for a friend . - She \\'s the dizziest dame I ever seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eddie . Look what I got ! Look what I got ! - Where \\'d you get all this stuff ? - Eddie give us 60 cents to buy it . Aw , he \\'s crazy . It was - Sixty-Oh , what did you wan na come up here for anyway ? Go on outside and play . Go on . Go on . Go on now . Get out of here . Thanks a lot , Eddie ! Gim me a slice of that cone down there . Poor kids . I found \\' em downstairs in that dark hallway tryin \\' to play games . They ai n\\'t got a chance in life . Eddie , did you give him the 60 cents ? Listen , I got better things to do with my money ... than throw it away on a lot of kids . Say , you \\'re a swell egg . What are you gon na sell in your radio store ? Never mind . The way you run people \\'s business for them ... if you start butting \\' in , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I \\'m going . - Remember now . Tell him . - Tell him what ? Oh , nothing , Eddie . She \\'s got a secret for ya . Oh , she \\'s got a secret for me , but you know it . Geez , you \\'re runnin \\' my house for me , too , I see . - Sure . Bye , darlin \\' . - See you tomorrow . - Bye , grouch . - So long , dizzy . - What \\'s the big secret ? - I do n\\'t know whether you \\'ll like it or not . Hey , listen , kid . I \\'m so happy about the store , I \\'d like anything . Oh . Well ? What is it ? Eddie , I \\'m going back to work . - Back to work ? - Yeah . Hey , listen . No wife of mine is goin \\' to work . - What \\'d be the harm ? - I \\'ll do all the work that \\'s to be done in this family . - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well-Well , it gets kind of lonesome staying \\' here all day all alone . Ca n\\'t you go to picture shows and things ? You just said we \\'d have to pinch nickels . Yeah , but I did n\\'t mean we \\'d have to pinch \\' em that hard . - You do n\\'t like livin \\' in just one room . Is that it ? - Oh , it \\'s all right . But I wish we had a flat of our own or something-you know , our own furniture . Ca n\\'t you see , Eddie ? If I went to work , you could have your store just the same . And with the money I make , we could-Do you think I \\'d take money you worked for ? - Oh , it \\'d be all right . - Not with me , it would n\\'t . My idea of a husband is a guy that looks after his wife and takes care of her ... and sees that she do n\\'t want for nothin \\' . If I ca n\\'t do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money- you work all day- or let you use it for something that I ought to be payin \\' for . Listen . They got a name for guys like that . Oh , Eddie , I did n\\'t mean to make you sore . I ai n\\'t sore . But I ai n\\'t as happy as I was . You can lay that on a line . It was our 10 weeks anniversary . And I had the store all picked out and everything . And , say , when I come in here tonight , I was walkin \\' on air . This kinda crumbs it all up . Gee , I did n\\'t know you was n\\'t satisfied . Oh , Eddie , I am satisfied . It \\'s all right . Let \\'s not talk about it . - I \\'ll bet that Edna jane put that idea in your nut . - No , she did n\\'t . Let \\'s not say any more about it . You \\'re crazy to have the store , and it \\'ll make you happy . Well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I \\'m the husband , and it \\'s my job to make you happy . If a husband ai n\\'t for that , he ai n\\'t for nothin \\' . Gee , I told the real estate guy I \\'d meet him tonight . I ca n\\'t make up my mind about that sign . \\' \\' Eddie Collins \" or \\' \\' Edward Collins \" ? Course , \\' \\' Eddie Collins \" is all right for a saloon or somethin \\' like that . Nope , it ai n\\'t got class enough for a radio store . I \\'ll be back in 15 or 20 minutes . And I still think that Edna jane put that idea in your nut . I was afraid you was n\\'t comin \\' . What \\'s the idea of phoning \\' me to meet you here ? - Dot and me are movin \\' here . - You \\'re movin \\' here ? Sure . I got new furniture and everything . That \\'s why I asked you to come . I thought maybe you \\'d help me put \\' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anyway , so I figured out you might as well do it in the beginning . You \\'re moving here ? Yeah . Dot told me that secret . What \\'s that got to do with your moving and spending your money ? She wanted to go to work . - You mean that \\'s the secret she told you ? - Yeah . So I put two and two together and figured out why . She wanted a home with nice furnishings and things . - Say , how much did all this cost you ? - I shot the bankroll . - Oh , no . - Yeah . - All you \\'d saved ? - Sure . This is a swell joint . The furniture man is takin \\' charge . I bought everything new- from soup to nuts . When it \\'s finished , it \\'ll look just like a home that somebody \\'s lived in for a long time . Some surprise for the kid , huh ? Yeah , but what about your store ? Well , I figured , why let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build up a business ? I might \\'ve made a flop of the store anyhow . Not that I would \\'ve . I \\'d have made a success of it . Do n\\'t get that idea in your nut . And you spent all your savings ? Sure . She \\'s worth it . She \\'s a great kid . You \\'ll have me crying in a minute , Eddie . What for ? You would n\\'t know . Come on . You never saw anything sweller than that parlor set I bought . Come on . Wait till you get a load of the bedroom . It \\'s got sheets and pillowcases and beds and everything in it . And the kitchen- We got a lot of pots and pans . It \\'s gon na be like a party . See , I \\'m gon na tell Dot that Pat and Sue have got a new flat ... and are havin \\' a housewarming and we \\'re invited . I asked a lot of the gang , and they \\'re in on it too . It \\'s gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . And the big payoff comes when I say ... \\' \\' Well , kid , how do you like your new home ? \" What do you think of the idea ? - I do n\\'t know . - You did n\\'t think it up . That \\'s why . Hey , wait a minute . Do n\\'t put that great big chair over there by the divan . - That \\'s where the chair belongs . - No , it is n\\'t . It belongs over on this side . Have n\\'t you got any sense of balance ? - You would get your mouth in it some way or another . dd Hey , hey . Wait until they get here . Aw , have a heart . I have n\\'t had any supper . And do n\\'t drink up all the punch . Here they are . Listen , Pat . Remember , this is supposed to be your home . You \\'re the host . - Right . I \\'ll take off my coat and collar . - That ai n\\'t funny . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Go on . I did n\\'t even know that Pat had moved from 92nd Street . Sure . They got a swell place here . - Hello , Dot . How are you ? - Hello , Sue . - Hello , Eddie . - I did n\\'t know that you \\'d moved . Oh , I \\'ve been here a week . Come in . Hi , everybody . - Hello , Chad . How are you ? - Hello , Dot . - Hello , Pat . How are you ? - Let me take your coat . - Have a schnapps . - Oh , no , thanks . Oh , gee , Sue , this is swell . Pat must have murdered a millionaire or something . Hey , you ai n\\'t seen nothin \\' yet . Come on out here and I \\'ll show you the kitchen . You \\'d think this was his house . Come on . Let \\'s eat . A closet , and it \\'s got glass in it too . And a sink and a washtub . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you keep your salt and pepper and spices and things . In the one marked \\' \\' Salt , \" you keep the salt . In the one marked \\' \\' Pepper , \" you keep the pepper . Gee , Eddie , ai n\\'t it swell ? Look at that darling table . The guy said it was the breakfast nook . Oh , Eddie , you think we \\'ll ever have a place like this ? - Would you like to live here , kid ? - Oh , gee , would I ? - Of course , we could n\\'t afford-- Why not ? Well , we could n\\'t afford the money now . Well , why now ? - Well , you wan na get your store first . - Yeah . Oh , yeah . That \\'s right . Say , wait till you get a load of the bedroom . Come on ! Say , if Eddie can get Dot a home like this , why ca n\\'t you get me one ? I thought that \\'d crop up . - Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kid . There \\'s a bed . You ca n\\'t buy a better bed than that- 65 bucks . - But how did you-- Oh , Pat told me . Come on . Feel it . Just feel it . Ai n\\'t this a bed ? Not like that old egg crate we sleep in . I \\'ve never seen you so enthusiastic . The house has sure made a hit with you . Come on . Now I \\'m gon na show you somethin \\' . Just grand . There \\'s the bridges over there . And there \\'s all New York to pick from . Ai n\\'t the lights great ? And the East River . And stars . Are n\\'t they beautiful ? Not phony one\\'s either . Gee , a roof like this would be a swell place for ... kids to play . Would n\\'t it , Eddie ? You know , they could get plenty of fresh air ... and their mothers would n\\'t have to worry about streetcars ... and taxis and trucks and things . You know , rich kids could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , do n\\'t you , kid ? Oh , I think it \\'s just grand . I \\'m awful glad for Pat and Sue . Okay . We better get back to the bunch now . You said it . Sue , it \\'s the grandest flat I ever saw . - I \\'m awfully glad you like it , Dot . - Oh , it \\'s sweet for anything . Dot , sit down . Here goes . Well , kid , it \\'s yours . - Mine ? What do you mean , mine ? - Sure . Yours . This is where you \\'re gon na live . I bought it for you . - You bought it for me ? - Sure . You know that secret about goin \\' back to work ? Well , I doped it out that you was n\\'t satisfied where you \\'re livin \\' . So this is the answer . - Well , what about your store ? - Thls Is It . You spent all your money for this ? I shot the works . - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t owe a nickel on It . Well , what do ya say ? I do n\\'t know . Do n\\'t seem to make such a hit with ya now . Naturally , Eddie . She \\'s surprised . You ca n\\'t get a thing like this through your head in a minute . - Did you know he was doing it , Edna ? - Yeah , I helped him fi ? x It up . Why \\'d you let him spend all the money ? Well , folks , it looks like a bust . Oh , no , it is n\\'t , Eddie . I think it \\'s just great . I \\'m tickled to death . - You \\'re the swellest husband any girl ever had . - Okay . Dot \\'s only disappointed for you , Eddie . She was so anxious for you to have the store ... she did n\\'t want you to spend the money for anything else . - That \\'s right . - Sure . That \\'s why , dear . You know I think it \\'s just swell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a long time dead . Live while ya can . That \\'s what I say . When I think of the way my folks used to live . They did n\\'t have enough money to support themselves ... so they go and have nine kids . My old lady used to scrub floors in an office building . 4:00 every morning she went to work- sick or well , summer or winter . I can see her goin\\'out when It was 20 below zero ... with a cough that \\'d tear the heart out of ya . And for what ? To bring up a couple ofklds and die- dle before they was ever any comfort to her . Not for Dot . Every nickel I make , she and I are gon na spend on ourselves . - My sister died bringing up-- Oh , stop it ! Ca n\\'t you stop it ! You \\'d think there was nothin \\' else in the world to talk about . All right . There , there , dear . Shh . What \\'s wrong ? Dot \\'s going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eddle . No , she \\'s just a little hysterical . That \\'s all . We should n\\'t have talked about those things . - That \\'s right . I guess we shouldn\\'t . - Sue told me , but I forgot . Gee , everybody in New York seems to know about it ... but the only guy that \\'s interested . Oh , gee , Eddie , I wish you \\'d let me do that . Do n\\'t be crazy , will ya ? You \\'re goin \\' to the hospital in a few weeks . You know the doc told you not to do any hard work . I do n\\'t think he knows what he \\'s talkin \\' about . I do n\\'t like him . - You want me to get you a different one ? - No . If you ca n\\'t get the best , he \\'s as good as any of the others , I guess . He \\'s all right . I worry . That \\'s all . - About what ? - About everything . You having to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pinching \\' every nickel the way you have . I do n\\'t want a baby any more than you do . All right , all right . Now you told me that a thousand times . Let \\'s not talk about it . Is there any other doctor you got in mind ? There was somethin \\' in the paper about a society woman . The doctor \\'s name was Burgess . His picture was there . Gee , he was awful kind-lookin \\' . Not that we could get him . He \\'s only for millionaires . As long as you ca n\\'t get him , you might as well pick out the best . Whoo-ooh ! Dot ! Now do n\\'t bring her in here . I do n\\'t want her razzin \\' me . - Good morning . - Hello , Edna . - Hello , Eddie . - So long . Floyd made such a racket , I did n\\'t wait for breakfast . - Got a cup of coffee ? - Sure . Hmm . You got a new washerwoman , I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t got enough bluing in this water . I knew somethin \\' would be wrong with it when you seen it . - Here . - Thanks . Got a cigarette ? No , I cut \\' em out . They was puttin \\' my throat on the bum . Come on , Edna . Drink this in the other room . Yeah , go on . Beat it , will ya ? You give me the willies . That \\'s good . - How do you feel ? - Oh , all right . - How do you feel when you feel bad ? - I worry . Yeah , and you worry other people too . You worry him . Your child \\'ll probably grow up to be a radio broadcaster . Gee , It \\'s 10 minutes to 8 . ? 00 . I got ta blow . Do n\\'t touch those things . I \\'ll finish \\' em when I come home . - Good-bye , darling . - So long . - So long , meddlesome . - Good-bye , grouch . Break a leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so miserable . - What ? - He \\'s so square about everything . Says smoking hurts his throat . He cut it out so he could save the money . It does n\\'t seem fair that he should give up all his fun just because of me . Yeah , it \\'s tough on husbands . Nobody knows what a husband suffers when his wife has a baby ... and a big juicy raspberry . It must be great for a woman when everything is right- you know , when she can afford a doctor like that man Burgess ... and when she knows her husband wants the baby . You want it , do n\\'t you , Dot ? I \\'m crazy about it . That is , I would be ... if it were n\\'t for Eddie and if I was n\\'t afraid . - How do you know he does n\\'t want it ? - The things he says . I can feel it , too , in the way he acts . He does n\\'t like children . Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? - Only seven months . Of course , all parents are proud of their children . But honestly , even if this was somebody else \\'s kid ... I \\'d have to admit it \\'s the cleverest youngster I ever saw . - Do n\\'t you think so , Mama ? - I honestly do . Hey , lookit ! The little son of a gun \\'s got ahold of my finger . That \\'s what I mean . Is n\\'t that clever ? - She \\'s a darling . Look at her . - Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie , coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Hey , Eddie . Eddie . Eddie . - Has Mr . Randall \\'s set been fixed for him ? - Yes , sir . - Gee , that \\'s a great kid you got . - We think so . - Say , Mr . Lathrop ? - Yes ? Do you think that a woman havin \\' a baby ... you know , that she has n\\'t always wanted ... could-could learn to love it ... you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your wife , eh ? She \\'s afraid . Say , there ai n\\'t any danger in these things , is there ? Well , lots of women manage to have babies ... without calling out the militia . There \\'s no danger when they have the proper attention . She should be made to have confidence in her doctor . That \\'s just it . My wife ai n\\'t got any . That \\'s not right . - She speaks of a Dr . Burgess . - Burgess ? You \\'d have to be a millionaire to have him . - Goin \\' to lunch , Eddie ? - Nah , I cut lunches out . I was gettin \\' too fat . - This Dr . Burgess is good , huh ? - And expensive . When a king is born , they send for him . I wonder how you could get in to see a guy like that . - Mr . Lathrop , will you take a look at this set , please ? - Oh , yes . Certainly . Hey , Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club ? - Yeah . Do you suppose he could get me on in one of them preliminary fights ? Say , some of those boys are pretty good . - What do you wan na take a beatin \\' for ? - Ten bucks a round . Four rounds- 40 bucks . I can use that dough swell . - I can fix it for ya , but I think you \\'re nutty . - Okay . 7:00 . Say , ai n\\'t that job of yours got any hours ? A guy wanted his radio fixed , so I did it on the side . I should think you \\'d try gettin \\' home ... with your wife goin \\' to the hospital and everything . - How is she ? - She \\'s worrying herself sick . That \\'s how she is . But , gee , she ought n\\'t to do that . I do n\\'t think she knows that . You ought to tell her . - You had any supper ? - I ai n\\'t hungry . Gettin \\' your beauty sleep , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hurt you to hang around once in a while . Okay . That \\' \\' okay \" does me a lot of good , do n\\'t it ? Gee , kid , you know I \\'m for you , do n\\'t ya ? Well , it do n\\'t look like it . You have n\\'t spent an evening in the house for two weeks now . I do n\\'t mean to be a grouch , Eddie , but ... I \\'m frightened . Is it the doctor ? Is that what makes you afraid ? Oh , he \\'s all right , I guess . It \\'s my fault . You know , you have confidence in some people , and others you have n\\'t . There \\'s no reason . You just have . That \\'s all . Sure , I know how it is , kid . Eddie , you \\'re gon na stick around and go to the hospital with me tonight , ai n\\'t ya ? You betcha . No . Wait a minute . - I tell ya , I got ta go out-- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Oh , no . Just for a half an hour , kid . - Ca n\\'t even stay with me tonight . I \\'ll be right back . Honest I will . Mmm . Your honey is searching among the \\' \\' bees . \" Hello ? Yeah , this is his secretary . Mm-hmm . Who wants to talk to him ? Joe ? - There \\'s a Joe wants to talk to you . - Hello , Joe . Tonight ? Sure I \\'ll be there . Hey , that \\'s great . It comes just at the right time . Thanks . So long . I \\'ll be a little longer now , but I \\'ll be back at 9:00 . I got another fella to see now . - You pick a swell night to make a date . - You sure do . This ai n\\'t a date . Honest it ain\\'t . - I \\'ll be back as quick as I can . - Give my love toJenny , will ya ? - WhatJenny ? - WhateverJenny happens to be there . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital . But I \\'m sure the doctor you have is competent . It ai n\\'t that . You see , she \\'s just a kid herself , and she \\'s frightened . Her mother died that way . She read about you In the paper , Dr . Burgess . Well , of course , we never thought we could get ya . She was sayin\\'that It would be swell ... If she could get a guy like you to be with her . Did you tell her you were coming to see me ? No , sir . She and me ai n\\'t been gettin \\' along very well lately . I \\'ve been workin \\' nights . I did n\\'t tell her about it . She thinks I \\'ve been chiseling \\' on her , I guess . I ca n\\'t tell things like that . I \\'m kind of a mug that way . Of course , I could n\\'t pay you what you \\'re worth . But I tell ya . I make 45 bucks a week , and pick up 15 workin \\' nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight tonight . And I got 381 saved up , see ? - Are you a prizefighter ? - No , sir . But a friend of mine \\'s gettin \\' me on ... in the preliminaries over at the Empire Club . I get 10 bucks a round , and I do n\\'t mind takin \\' a beating for 40 bucks . Llsten , Dr . Burgess-I always been kinda proud , see ? You know , pay my own way , take nothin \\' from nobody . But I ai n\\'t that way now , Doc . I \\'m beggin \\' you . If she knew she was gon na have you with her ... everything would be all right . But as it is ... she \\'s so sick from worry-I \\'m afraid maybe she \\'ll die . Will you do it , Doc ? I \\'ll give you the $381 I got saved up ... and I \\'ll pay you back dollar for dollar . Please do it , will ya , Doc ? So help me , God , I\\'ll- I \\'ll lay down my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks . - I guess I \\'m kinda nervous about this child thing . - Mm-hmm . Kinda goofy , huh ? Gee , Doc , I \\'m sorry I have n\\'t got a cigar or somethin \\' to offer ya . I cut out smokin \\' . It was hurtin \\' my throat . This is a swell dump you got here . Oh , I did n\\'t mean-Okay . Flght ! - He said 9:00 . - Do n\\'t worry . You \\'d think the least he could do would be to be with me tonight . Now , now , now . Do n\\'t get yourself all worked up . One , two-Get out . Get out . Hey , Mike , knock that fella out , will ya ? This ai n\\'t a slaughterhouse . I wanted to give him a break , but I \\'ll put him away right at the next gong . Aw , why do n\\'t ya quit ? I know what I \\'m doin \\' . I would n\\'t take a beatin \\' like that for a hundred bucks . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . One , two , three , four ... five , six ... seven , eight , nine-Uh ! Do n\\'t knock me out , will ya , buddy ? I need the cash . - My wife \\'s gon na have a kid . - Well , why did n\\'t you tell me ? I guess I ca n\\'t make it though . Hold on to me . Take a deep breath . Break it up . Thanks . Good-bye . I \\'ve arranged for the hospital . The cab will be here at 11:00 . I never thought Eddie would do this to me . But , darling , he \\'s only an hour late . Some hours are lifetimes . He \\'s walked out on me . - When \\'s the kid expected ? - Any-Anytime now . - I got two of them . - Yeah ? How long before they get to know ya ? Mine knew me inside of two months . - But of course , mine was kinda extra bright . - Yeah . Oh , gee , kid , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad about you . - I could n\\'t help it . Could n\\'t spend a couple of minutes with me , tonight of all nights ? You know how nervous I am . But you could go to some speakeasy with a bunch of fellas ... and get your face all battered up in a drunken brawl . Is that what ya think ? That \\'s what it looks like to me . Okay . Do you want me to go with ya ? You do n\\'t have to bother about me anymore at all , Eddie . I got Burgess for ya ! - How about it , Doctor ? - Congratulations . Twins . - Twins ? - Twins . - Boys or girls ? - Both . - Twins ! - Yes , sir . The baby business is picking up . Sometimes I was here , and I was the only one . - This your first ? - Yes , and my last . I would n\\'t go through this again for all the money in the world . How many kids have you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t know . You do n\\'t know ? I know I got six . What \\'s happening upstairs , I ca n\\'t tell ya . Here I am . You \\'re the father of a fine baby girl , Mr . Vernon . - Oh , well . - Oh ! - Put him over here on the-- It was too much for him . - He \\'ll be all right . - What \\'s the matter with him ? - I \\'ve got some smelling salts . - That \\'s fine . Give him some . - He \\'ll be all right . - He \\'s as white as a sheet . He \\'ll be all right in a minute . People kid about fathers , but they do n\\'t realize ... what a guy has to go through when his wife has a baby . If he had as many as I got , he \\'d stay unconscious . He \\'s coming to now . He \\'s fine . - What happened ? - You just had a baby . I would n\\'t go through this again for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or he \\'ll faint again . - It \\'s all right , Mr . Vernon . You come with me . - Hold him up . - Gee , I \\'m gettin \\' nervous myself now . Do n\\'t be nervous . Say , Mr . Linsky , I wan na ask you a question . My wife was n\\'t any too anxious to- to have this kid . Say , in two weeks , she will be crazy about it . - Is that straight ? - They always are . Be careful . Do n\\'t let her think that you are more concerned for the baby ... than what you are for her . Women get jealous under those conditions . You know , be interested , but not anxious . After all , you \\'ve known your wife for years ... and the baby is practically a stranger . Yeah , that \\'s right . Excuse me . I got ta phone my partner . Mr . Collins ? - Yeah ? - A boy . Okay . Your wife will see you in just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know about that ? My kid \\'s 22 hours old already . They get old very quickly when they \\'re young . - Hello , Doctor . How are they ? - Fine . Say , Doc , I \\'ve got 350 bucks here . - And I \\'ll give ya-- Yeah , well , I have your bill here . Now , I have another patient . I must hurry . - Good luck to you , my lad . - Thanks . Gee , he \\'ll never let me speak to him about money . It says paid in full . And here \\'s a check . \\' \\' Pay to the order of Mr . Edward Collins \\'s son- $50 . \" What does that mean ? He \\'s giving your boy $50 to start a bank account . And he would n\\'t let me give him anything . Gee . That \\'s a guy for ya , ai n\\'t it ? Oh , they \\'re just grand , Mrs . Linsky . Every time I have a baby , my husband gives me a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t have any more room . - What do you think of it ? - Oh . Oh , no , this is n\\'t yours . This baby \\'s six days old . She acts like she hates the child . I guess maybe she did n\\'t want it . Do parents hate children they do n\\'t want ? I heard of people like that . How do you like this one ? - Oh , it \\'s darling . - Oh , no . This is young Mussolini . dd Gee , it \\'s funny when you think of it , ai n\\'t it ? Everybody in the world was once just a little bundle like that . - Is n\\'t this one cute ? - Oh , it \\'s lovely . Just look at those little hands . Did you ever see such an adorable nose ? Gee , it \\'s swell . Do n\\'t you want to hold your baby ? Is this mine ? - Honest ? Oh . - Thls Is It . I would n\\'t cry over It , Mrs . Colllns . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ? Well , it \\'s the first time this baby was ever born . You can come in now . Hello , kid . - How do you feel ? - All right . Thanks for sending me the flowers . Okay . - Is that it ? - Yes , that \\'s it , and it \\'s no \\' \\' it . \" Well , I did n\\'t mean it that way . Let \\'s not talk about it . - That suits me too , kid . - I thought it would . We \\'ll take him back to the nursery now . I asked Dr . Burgess how we happened to get a fine doctor like him . He just laughed and said that you \\'d tell me . Oh , my boss knew him . He did it for him . - He give me a check for the baby \\'s bank too . - He did ? - Was n\\'t that swell of him ? - Yeah . Those big guys do a lot of work for charity . So you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-Well - Gee , everything I say seems to be wrong . Oh , Eddie . I \\'d give anything if- well , if things were different . Aw , everything \\'s gon na be all right , kid . We ai n\\'t gon na stop living just because we got a baby . You and me is gon na have a good time , the same as always . Why , In six months we \\'ll have forgotten we got a kid . Please go now . I \\'m tired . Sure . - When \\'ll you be home ? - In about two weeks . Well , hurry it up . I \\'ll feel like stepping \\' out a bit . - So long , kid . - So long . I \\'ll be back every day . Oh , Mrs . Linsky , she \\'s getting bigger every day . What are you going to call her ? I \\'m calling her Shelly , after my mother-in-law . Her name was Esther , but it \\'s close enough . Well , how are all the mothers today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the cab downstairs ? - Yes . Are you ready ? Mm-hmm . - Are you leaving now ? - Yes . But I heard you tell your husband that you were going tomorrow . - I want to surprise him . - Oh . Say , listen , kid . - Have you thought this thing over ? - Yep . I could n\\'t live with a man that did n\\'t like his own child . All he thinks about is stepping out . I could n\\'t go back to Eddie for anything . I \\'d get to hate him . Well , it \\'s your funeral , kid . Well , what are you going to do with that ? Well , I thought maybe the kid would like to fool around with it . What ? A two-weeks-old baby ? Well , it \\'s only a little balloon . The doctor \\'s in the ward . You \\'ll have to wait a few minutes . - Dr . Gibson ? - Yes ? Just a minute , please . - Hurry , Nurse Parson . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My baby . Something \\'s happened to my baby ! Somethlng \\'s happening to my baby . No , Mrs . Collins . It \\'s all right . - I want my baby ! I want my baby ! - He \\'s all right . - I want my baby ! - Please listen . I want my baby ! I want my baby ! I want my baby ! - I want my baby ! - What \\'s the matter , kid ? - Something \\'s happened to my baby . - Where ? In there ! It \\'s not your baby . There \\'s no danger . Your husband will get it . Now , everything is all right . - It \\'s all right . - He \\'s all right , kid . Look . Here he is . - He \\'s all right . - It was Mrs . Burns \\'s baby . Nothing serious . Just a little coughing spell . Oh , gee , kid . I did n\\'t know you liked it . And I thought all along that you did n\\'t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your nut . The things you said that night in the flat- you know , about your mother and everything . Well , I thought like that then . But gee , it \\'s different when you got your own kid . Hey , lookit . The little son of a gun \\'s got ahold of my finger . - Dr . Burgess said he had a finely shaped head . - He did ? Hey , look out there , buddy . You might have the future president of the United States in this cab . That \\'s what they all say . - Oh , yeah ? - Oh , Eddie . Now do n\\'t , Eddie . Hey . Let me hold him , will ya ? - You really want to , Eddie ? - Sure . Be careful . Put your arm under his head . - Okay . - There you go , baby . Say , Dr . Burgess was right about the kid \\'s head .
