  Sharing the story of Lila Barber, a 12 year old girl from Westerly, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Tuesday, April 10, 2007, illustrated the hope stem cell research can offer in a speech on the Senate floor in favor of legislation to expand federal funding for stem cell research.  
   Whitehouse met Lila two weeks ago. She was diagnosed two years ago with osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone condition, and last year underwent cadaver bone transplant surgery. The procedure saved her leg and is helping her remain cancer-free, but the transplanted tissue will not grow with her and likely will break down over time. Stem cell research, Whitehouse explained, could vastly improve the care of patients like Lila by allowing surgeons to enhance transplants with a patient's own stem cells, which could replace the lost bone and cartilage, or grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. 
   ""Stem cell research gives hope to Lila and millions of Americans challenged by osteosarcoma, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, stroke, and a myriad of diseases and conditions this research might help or even cure,"" Whitehouse said. 
   Whitehouse also praised the efforts of Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin (D), a champion of stem cell legislation nationally and in Rhode Island, as well as Rhode Island Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Roberts. Roberts today released a statewide report on stem cells, a first step toward developing a comprehensive plan for research initiatives in Rhode Island. 
   The Stem Cell Enhancement Act (S. 5) expands the number of human embryonic stem cells eligible for federally-funded research beyond the arbitrary limits imposed by President Bush in August 2001. The bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct research on stem cells derived from embryos currently stored in fertility clinics that would otherwise be destroyed. 
   Last year, 63 senators voted to pass the Stem Cell Enhancement Act (H.R. 810), legislation similar to S. 5. President Bush issued the first veto of his presidency to block the bipartisan measure.

1,10Apr2008Whitehouse2.txt,"SEN. WHITEHOUSE SAYS PRESIDENT BUSH MUST BEGIN BRINGING TROOPS HOME FROM IRAQ
  President Bush's refusal to say when American troops will come home from Iraq leaves America less safe and adds to the already-immense burdens facing service members and their families, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said today. 
   Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who traveled to Iraq a year ago, reiterated his belief that an announcement that the United States plans to redeploy its forces is the strongest weapon at our disposal to bring about political progress in Iraq:
   ""It's time for President Bush to listen to the American people and take action to bring our troops home from Iraq. Today, again, the President made clear that he has no intention of doing that.
   ""Iraq is embroiled in a sectarian civil war. It's clear the violence will not stop until the Iraqis take responsibility for the security and governance of their nation. To hasten that day of reconciliation, America can do one thing and one thing only: we must announce that we will redeploy our troops.
   ""Instead, President Bush has chosen to leave our servicemen and women in harm's way indefinitely, with no assurance of when, or under what conditions, they will come home. America's military has been strained almost to the breaking point, taking a serious toll on the health and welfare of our service members and their families, and leaving us ill-prepared to face gathering threats around the world.
   ""With more than 4,000 American lives lost and hundreds of billions of American tax dollars spent, the most important question for our nation is this: when can our troops return? President Bush's refusal to answer that question fails our troops, repudiates the will of the American people, and mortgages our country's security and our future.""

2,10Apr2008Whitehouse3.txt,"EPA MUST REVIEW LEGAL PROCESS TO ROOT OUT POLITICAL INFLUENCE, SEN. WHITEHOUSE TELLS NOMINEE
  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must undertake a thorough, comprehensive review of the process by which the agency makes decisions to determine whether Bush administration officials have put political considerations above science and the law, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said today at a confirmation hearing for the nominee to be EPA's general counsel. 
   ""The fact that the courts of the United States have felt compelled to characterize the positions EPA has taken in recent litigation by referring to Humpty Dumpty and Alice in Wonderland is embarrassing both to the agency and to the American people,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the EPW Committee. ""I'm deeply concerned that this Administration appears to be making legal decisions that impact our environment and public health not on their merits or their likelihood of success, but to advance a political agenda that risks lasting harm to our country.""
   At today's confirmation hearing, the EPW Committee heard testimony from David Hill, President Bush's nominee to be General Counsel of the EPA. Whitehouse closely questioned Hill on his commitment to helping EPA regain the stature and independence it has lost during the Bush Administration.
   There have been numerous signs that the decision-making process at EPA in recent years, and particularly under current Administrator Stephen L. Johnson, has been compromised by political considerations that disregard the demands of federal law and scientific evidence. Since 2001, federal courts have reversed a significant number of EPA's rules, including decisions relating to mercury emissions, water pollution discharges, new source review, and restrictions on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks.
   In New York v. EPA, decided in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said EPA's legal argument supporting its decision to weaken new source review requirements belonged ""in a Humpty Dumpty world."" In New Jersey v. EPA, decided two years later, the same court said EPA's position employs ""the logic of the Queen of Hearts."" Hill acknowledged during today's hearing that he had reviewed those cases.
   Yesterday, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-CA) subpoenaed Administrator Johnson for the third time this year to compel the release of documents related to the EPA's denial of a request by California, Rhode Island, and other states to set strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles. Documents reviewed by staff members of the EPW Committee showed that EPA's professional staff pushed Johnson to approve the California waiver, and demonstrated concerns among EPA staff that a denial of the waiver request would not survive a challenge in court. The documents also showed that Johnson consulted with White House officials on the waiver issue.
   On January 2, 2008, California, Rhode Island, and several other states and environmental organizations sued EPA to overturn Johnson's decision. The suit is now pending in the D.C. Circuit Court.

3,10Aug2007Whitehouse78.txt,"R.I. SENATORS PRAISE SEN. DENIAL OF LNG FACILITY PERMIT
  U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) praised today's decision by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) to deny a dredging permit to Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC. The agency said the company's application to dredge 230,000 cubic yards of sediment from the federal navigational channel in Mount Hope Bay was ""incomplete and insufficient."" 
   ""This news is a positive development for opponents of this proposal, and I hope the Army Corps of Engineers draws on DEM's work as the Corps makes its own permitting decisions,"" said Reed.
   ""DEM's decision recognizes the significant risks LNG tanker traffic would pose to the ecological health of Narragansett Bay and the safety of surrounding communities,"" Whitehouse said. ""I'm committed to doing all I can to help stop this facility.""
   According to a DEM news release, Weaver's Cove did not provide essential information on the projected impact of dredging on water quality and marine life, and significantly expanded the proposed number of tankers that would transit the Bay after a deadline had passed.

  A year after President Bush's speech to the nation announcing that he would significantly increase U.S. troop levels in Iraq, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) criticized the administration's continued failure to change course and begin bringing our troops home: 
  ""In 2006, the American people sent a clear message to Washington that it was time to seek a new direction in Iraq. Instead, a year ago today President Bush escalated the war, sending tens of thousands more troops into harm's way with assurances that the leaders of Iraq would step forward and work towards political reconciliation. Today, one year later, our troops have performed their duties as directed with skill and bravery - but the Iraqis have not done their part, and the Bush administration has not in its own conduct measured up to their sacrifice. 
  ""Iraq will never stand up until we prepare to stand down. I have told President Bush personally that the prospect of an American redeployment is our best pressure on Iraqi leaders to take responsibility for the security and governance of their country. America cannot continue pouring billions of dollars and thousands of lives and limbs into the sands and marshes of Iraq. The Bush Administration cannot shirk the tough choices it must make. We must announce the process of bringing our troops home.""

  U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) welcomed Rhode Island's two U.S. Senate Youth Program (USSYP) delegates to Washington, D.C. last week. High school students Miranda Cummings of East Providence and David Thibodeau of North Providence were in the nation's capital for the program's 46th annual Washington Week. Both students also will receive a $5,000 grant towards their undergraduate college education. 
   ""I commend these students for their academic achievements and leadership in their schools and communities,"" said Reed.
   ""Selection for the Senate Youth Program is an important achievement, and I'm proud that David and Miranda have taken advantage of this opportunity to learn more about their government,"" Whitehouse said.
   Ms. Cummings, a member of the National Honor Society, is a Student Council member at East Providence High School. She is also the editor of the school newspaper and participates in the French Club and the Drug Intervention Community Educators. Miranda plans to attend Providence College and major in social work.
   Mr. Thibodeau is the class president at LaSalle Academy. He is also an academic tutor, student council representative, and newspaper reporter, and he works as a page in the Rhode Island State Senate. At LaSalle, he is a member of the Academic Decathlon Team, New England Math and Calculus League, National Italian Honor Society, and Academic Honor Society. He plans to major in chemistry.
   The Senate Youth Program was created in 1962. The program is sponsored by the Senate and has been fully funded by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation since its inception. Each year, 104 students are selected on the basis of merit (two from each state, the District of Columbia and the Department of Defense Education Activity) to participate in USSYP's week-long, intensive study of the federal government, aimed at fostering a greater understanding of the political process and a strong commitment to public service. To date, more than 4,500 students have participated.

6,10Sep2007Whitehouse72.txt,"REP. WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON GEN. PETRAEUS IRAQ REPORT: TIME FOR TROOPS TO COME HOME
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) commented today on the long-awaited report by General David Petraeus on the Bush administration's ""surge"" strategy in Iraq:  
  ""It's time to send a clear signal to Iraq and the rest of the world that we are bringing our troops home. We're facing a simple question: is it in our country's best interests for our troops to remain in Iraq? From everything I've seen and heard, the answer is no - and for that reason, it's time to begin a rapid, responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq.
  ""In today's report by General Petraeus, the Bush administration argues that security in Iraq is improving - but with 160,000 American troops on the ground and more than $700 billion spent, we should expect some progress of some kind. What has not improved is the political environment necessary for Iraq to begin to stabilize and move forward. Nothing fundamental will change in Iraq unless its leaders have the will to work together.
  ""Our troops need to come home. Then, we can return our focus to issues here at home - from better health care to more affordable education to renewable sources of energy - that will challenge our nation's strength and security for years to come, and where we are losing ground because of this war.""

7,11Apr2007Whitehouse122.txt,"SEN. WHITEHOUSE URGES BUSH FOR NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) met with President Bush on Wednesday, April 11, to share firsthand the concerns of thousands of Rhode Islanders who believe we need a change of course in Iraq. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse recently traveled to Iraq as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  
   ""Rhode Islanders, and people throughout the country, have sent a clear message to this administration: it's time for a new direction in Iraq,"" Whitehouse said. ""Today, I had the chance to deliver that message to the President in person. I told him that we want to bring our troops home, and urged him to consider that the strongest force he has at his disposal for a resolution in Iraq is to announce a redeployment and a change of course."" 
   Whitehouse also gave President Bush several letters sent to him by Rhode Islanders concerned about the Bush administration's misguided policy in Iraq. 
   A Cumberland woman whose nephew is serving in Iraq wrote to the President: ""I am proud to be an American! Please, please on behalf of my family and the families of all US troops - bring them home now!"" 
   A woman from Harrisville wrote as her family member was waiting to be deployed: ""Our enemies want us to be mired in a pointless war, wasting our resources and our young people. They want us hurting. Withdrawing from Iraq is the smart thing to do, and that is what our enemies fear most."" 
   A Johnston man whose son is serving in Iraq wrote: ""We the majority of the American people oppose this war and the escalation of troops, even our Generals both active and retired say the escalation of our troops will not help. It is time to bring our men home!"" 
   Several members of Congress were invited to meet with the President following recent official visits to Iraq. Whitehouse traveled there in mid-March on an official congressional delegation visit to meet with American troops and assess the situation on the ground. While in country, he talked with American military commanders, including General David Petraeus, as well as several high-ranking Iraqi officials and members of the U.S. embassy and intelligence staffs. Whitehouse also spoke with Marines from Rhode Island now serving in Fallujah. 
   Whitehouse joined a majority of the Senate to pass war funding legislation that would compel President Bush to begin redeploying American troops from Iraq within four months, with a goal of having all combat troops out of the country by March 31, 2008. Whitehouse also is a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) and supported by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) that will limit funding for the war after April 2008 to counter-terrorism, training, and force protection.

8,11Jan2007Whitehouse161.txt,"SENS. REED, WHITEHOUSE URGE PORTUGAL TO RECONSIDER POTENTIAL CLOSING OF RHODE ISLAND CONSULATE
  Sens. Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) have asked Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates to reconsider the potential closing of Portugal's consulate in Providence.  
   The full text of the letter is below. 
   January 10, 2007 
   Eng. Jose Socrates Sousa 
  Primeiro Ministro 
  Rue de Imprensa a Estrela 4 
  1200-888 Lisboa PORTUGAL 
   Dear Mr. Prime Minister: 
   We write regarding the potential closing of the Portuguese consulate in Rhode Island. 
   As United States Senators, we fully understand the financial pressures which require your decision to cut back on some foreign consulates. However, we would like to highlight the invaluable services the Providence consulate provides to the thousands of citizens of Portuguese descent in New England and how the consulate strengthens the bond between our two nations. 
   The Portuguese consulate in Providence has proved critical in informing residents of the state and the nation about Portugal's policies and concerns and its view of U.S. policy. The consulate offers regular communication with official representatives of the Portuguese government and enhances the ability of the Portuguese American citizens of Rhode Island to act together on behalf of these concerns. We and our staffs, as well as our constituents, have also found it useful to work with consular officials on a whole range of subjects. 
   The Portuguese American citizens of Rhode Island are dedicated, loyal Americans who contribute to our economy, while they continue to be proud of their Portuguese heritage, which is celebrated so vibrantly in Rhode Island. They rely on the Consulate for innumerable services. Many have contacted me to express their great concern about the potential loss of this valuable resource. While there is consular service in Boston, it is not necessarily easy for those in my state who are in need of consular services to travel there. In addition, the Providence Consulate has proved extremely valuable to my office, including on immigration issues. With Congress poised to consider potential changes in the U.S. immigration system, we foresee even more utilization of the consulate in the future. There is no substitute, even in the day of modern communications, for easy direct personal access among people who share important official concerns. 
   We understand this is a difficult decision that you must make together with your colleagues. However, we hope you will consider all that the Providence consulate provides to the state of Rhode Island and a significant Portuguese-American population. 
   Please feel free to contact us with any questions you may have, and thank you for your consideration. 
   Sincerely, 
   Jack Reed 
  United States Senator
   Sheldon Whitehouse 
  United States Senator.

9,11Mar2008Whitehouse7.txt,"WHITEHOUSE UNVEILS 'BUSH DEBT': $7.7 TRILLION IN FOREGONE SURPLUSES, LOST OPPORTUNITIES
  President Bush's irresponsible fiscal policies have cost America a staggering $7.7 trillion, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said today in remarks delivered on the Senate floor during debate on the Senate's budget resolution. Whitehouse said that the ""Bush Debt,"" a comprehensive account of the impact of surpluses squandered and new debt accumulated over the seven years under President Bush, demonstrates the need for new priorities and fiscal discipline as Congress considers the last budget resolution it will pass under the Bush presidency. 
   ""Instead of keeping our nation on the path to economic security and prosperity, to new investments in our health care system, our students, our seniors, and our veterans, the President who called for 'responsibility' squandered away the surpluses he inherited, mortgaged our children and grandchildren's futures, and compromised the quality of working Americans' lives,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Budget Committee. ""This President will leave behind millions of Americans who, had this Administration merely stayed the course of fiscal responsibility charted by President Clinton, would be far better off than they are today.""
   The ""Bush Debt"" was derived from a calculation of the difference between projections of the nation's fiscal outlook had policies in place under President Clinton been allowed to continue, and the reality under President Bush today. Whitehouse found that Bush's misguided policies, from the war in Iraq to tax breaks for the wealthy, have cost America $7.7 trillion in foregone surpluses and new debt.
   The President's budget for fiscal year 2009 also includes $260 billion in interest payments on the debt next year alone, or $857 for every woman, man, and child in the United States. These massive interest payments take away federal funds that could otherwise be used to benefit the American people. If that $260 billion were available to be spent for other purposes, Whitehouse said, we could provide health insurance to every uninsured American, double the maximum Pell Grant award, cover all remaining children eligible for Head Start, and fix virtually all the nation's bridges in need of repair.
   This week, the Senate is debating a budget resolution that would chart a very different course. This proposal, passed Thursday by the Senate Budget Committee, increases funding for veterans, schools, and transportation infrastructure and provides for a second economic stimulus package to help working families facing continued financial hardship. It would also lower taxes for the middle class and create jobs.
