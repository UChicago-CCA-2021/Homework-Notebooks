This is our donation page for 4-month-old baby Teera Kamat, born on August 14, 2020, diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 (SMA1). All she asks is one gene; can you help us get it for her?<br/><br/>I am Rama, Teera’s aunt, who is helping my cousin Mihir and sister in law Priyanka raise the funds required to save our little angel's life. They have very limited financial support in Mumbai, India, where Teera is now located and hospitals are ill equipped to treat such genetic conditions. My family are fundraising in India through their local crowdfunding platforms, but they have tried very hard but have only raised 15% of their total goal. They really need our help, and the clock is running out for Teera as each day passes.<br/><br/>SMA is a terrible disease, a rarest of rare genetic disorder that affects 1 in 10000 kids worldwide. Teera is missing one gene in her body that is required to make a very important protein. That protein keeps her nerve cells active, and without it, they wither away and die. She will have a lifespan of 6 months to 2 years depending on the progression of her condition.<br/><br/>On the surface, she looks like a normal happy child, but inside her condition is killing her nerves and muscles one by one. As the disease progresses she will not be able to move her hands and legs, sit up, crawl, hold her head, or do any of the things normal babies do. Her breathing will be labored; stomach muscles will give way, causing food to go back up to her lungs; and she will choke on her own spit and stomach fluids. Once the disease kills a particular nerve cell, we lose all function in that part of the body and this is irreversible. No amount of treatment given after the nerve cells die will help.<br/><br/>We have some hope. She currently has limited movement in her right leg and has some breathing issues, but is right now breathing and feeding on her own. The 2+ million dollar treatment called Zolgensma is available in the United States. This treatment, given to her now, could be a potential “cure”. As time passes, the effectiveness of the treatment will reduce. So we need to reach our goal within the next 2 months.<br/><br/>We appeal to your human side. You have the opportunity to save this beautiful baby. Please open your heart so we can reach our goal NOW and save her life.<br/><br/>Please help us spread the word. All our social media links and locations are available on Link tree - <a class=\"\" href=\"https://linktr.ee/donatetoteera\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://linktr.ee/donatetoteera</a> Every share, donation, encouraging word will help build our campaign up.<br/><br/>The Primary purpose of this fundraiser is to make Zolgensma available to Teera.  Payments from gofundme will be made out to the pharmaceutical company or their authorized subsidiary in lieu of purchasing this life saving treatment and making it available to Teera. We may also require to make payments to the hospital for pre and post procedure care, as well as any care required for monitoring Teera as part of the evaluation and treatment.</div><button class=\"a-text-button a-base-button\" data-element-id=\"btn_story_read-more\" type=\"button\">Read more</button></div>]"

      "On August 23rd my son was shot multiple times in the back by a Kenosha Police Department officer, after my son broke up an altercation by an unrelated party. The shooting has now left my son critically injured as he fights for his life. The extent of my son’s injuries is unknown, but we remain prayerful as he continues to undergo multiple rounds of operations to save his life.This fund is established to cover my son’s medical expenses, mental and grief counseling for our family and to assist our family in the days to come, as we continue to seek justice for Jacob.  A portion of these proceeds will also be used to benefit my son’s six children, some of whom witnessed this horrific act of violence.Anyone wishing to send cards, letters of encouragement  and/or contributions in the form of a money order or check, may do so by mail at: Julia Y.

      "PLEASE HELP ME IN THE BATTLE FOR MY LIFE. My name is Mimosa Selimaj. I am a wife and proud mother of a beautiful 2-year-old boy, Dean, and we live in New Milford, a small town in northern New Jersey. I was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer.  I need your help with medical expenses and family support in the fight for my life.On July 13th of this year, my entire world was turned upside down.  I was rushed to the ER with severe pain in my abdomen and the doctors discovered a large mass on my ovary. This set off a whirlwind of tests to understand the root cause of my illness. Days after my 35th birthday, and less than 2 years after having Dean, I was diagnosed with colon cancer.  The doctors initially thought it was ovarian cancer. They said they had to remove my ovary and I was rushed in for emergency surgery. I was horrified because my husband and I had just started trying for our second child.  The doctors gave us hope by explaining that I could become pregnant with one ovary, but our hearts were heavy. As it turned out, this was far from the worst of our problems. Days later, I received a diagnosis that will forever shake me to my core. I have Stage 4 colon cancer. It has spread to my lungs, liver and remaining ovary. As a statistic, I am grim.I was paralyzed from shock after hearing this news, in a constant state of tears. I thought about my baby, who needs his mother. I thought about all of the milestones I have witnessed in his short life, and the many more which lie ahead. I thought about our delightful, ordinary days.  Seeing his eyes light up at cars and trucks.  His hugs. Dean’s life without me is not a thought that my husband or I can swallow. Two months into chemotherapy treatments, I am in capable hands and grateful for my doctors. But I am quite ill from the treatments, and we have quickly learned that our insurance will not cover some of the most critical aspects of my longer-term care, including many alternative and integrative therapies and experimental trials.  I am a young mother, and a short life span of suboptimal quality simply will not do. My husband is becoming an expert in my care, and I recently became a vegan under the direction a nutritionist who challenges traditional approaches to cancer and food.  I also continue to be an active mom to Dean, who is blissfully unaware. He celebrated his 2nd birthday this month amid the great excitement of his new toys and trucks. In the coming months, I need to travel nationwide to get treatment from doctors who don’t accept my insurance and receive medicine that is not covered either. I will undoubtedly need primary care from my husband, who will have to take time off without pay. The financial costs we face are staggering, but we are strong and determined.  We will not give up without a fight that will make our son proud. We are telling you our story because we need your help. If you can make a financial donation to help us, we will forever be grateful. Our son will grow up knowing the goodness in others, who gave his mother a chance to continue fighting to be here for him. If you cannot donate, please share our story, or share stories with us about people who challenge traditional boundaries in the fight against cancer. Every little bit helps.Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read this.\n",

      "Hello well-wishers. This is our donation page for 4-month-old baby Teera Kamat, born on August 14, 2020, diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 (SMA1). All she asks is one gene; can you help us get it for her?I am Rama, Teera’s aunt, who is helping my cousin Mihir and sister in law Priyanka raise the funds required to save our little angel's life. They have very limited financial support in Mumbai, India, where Teera is now located and hospitals are ill equipped to treat such genetic conditions. My family are fundraising in India through their local crowdfunding platforms, but they have tried very hard but have only raised 15% of their total goal. They really need our help, and the clock is running out for Teera as each day passes.SMA is a terrible disease, a rarest of rare genetic disorder that affects 1 in 10000 kids worldwide. Teera is missing one gene in her body that is required to make a very important protein. That protein keeps her nerve cells active, and without it, they wither away and die. She will have a lifespan of 6 months to 2 years depending on the progression of her condition.On the surface, she looks like a normal happy child, but inside her condition is killing her nerves and muscles one by one. As the disease progresses she will not be able to move her hands and legs, sit up, crawl, hold her head, or do any of the things normal babies do. Her breathing will be labored; stomach muscles will give way, causing food to go back up to her lungs; and she will choke on her own spit and stomach fluids. Once the disease kills a particular nerve cell, we lose all function in that part of the body and this is irreversible. No amount of treatment given after the nerve cells die will help.We have some hope. She currently has limited movement in her right leg and has some breathing issues, but is right now breathing and feeding on her own. The 2+ million dollar treatment called Zolgensma is available in the United States. This treatment, given to her now, could be a potential “cure”. As time passes, the effectiveness of the treatment will reduce. So we need to reach our goal within the next 2 months.We appeal to your human side. You have the opportunity to save this beautiful baby. Please open your heart so we can reach our goal NOW and save her life.Please help us spread the word. All our social media links and locations are available on Link tree - https://linktr.ee/donatetoteera Every share, donation, encouraging word will help build our campaign up.The Primary purpose of this fundraiser is to make Zolgensma available to Teera.  Payments from gofundme will be made out to the pharmaceutical company or their authorized subsidiary in lieu of purchasing this life saving treatment and making it available to Teera. We may also require to make payments to the hospital for pre and post procedure care, as well as any care required for monitoring Teera as part of the evaluation and treatment.\n"

      "<p>Advances in genomics, neuroscience, synthetic biology, and nanoscience are merging with advances in computing and artificial intelligence, giving humans powers we have never had.  In the 20<sup>th</sup> century, we had to make decisions about the life of a single person. Today, we can make changes to the human genome that are permanently heritable and will reverberate across generations in perpetuity. The Hastings Center’s work in this focus area is to guide the use of these new, highly transformative powers most responsibly.</p>\n",

Ellisonc\\n\\nAbstract\\nMost research on segregation in social networks considers small circles of strong ties, and \\nlittle is known about segregation among the much larger number of weaker ties. This article \\nproposes a novel approach to the study of these more extended networks, through the use \\nof  data  on  personal  ties  in  an  online  social  network.  We  illustrate  this  method’s  potential \\nby  describing  and  explaining  the  degree  of  ethnic  and  gender  segregation  on  Facebook \\namong  a  representative  survey  of  adolescents  in  the  Netherlands  (N  =  2,810;  ~1.1  million \\nFacebook friends). The results show that large online networks are more strongly segregated \\nby ethnicity than by gender. Drawing on the same survey data, we find that core networks \\nare more segregated in terms of ethnicity and gender than are extended networks. However, \\nan  exception  to  this  pattern  is  personal  networks  of  ethnic  majority  members,  whose  core \\nnetworks are as segregated by ethnicity as their extended networks. Further analysis suggests \\nthis exception is due to their larger population size and the ethnic segregation of their social \\nsettings. We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of structural opportunities, \\nhomophily, and balance.\\n\\nKeywords\\nsegregation, ethnicity, gender, social networks, Facebook\\n\\nOne of the most consistent findings in socio-\\nlogical research is that strong-tie, core friend-\\nship  networks  tend  to  be  homogeneously \\nsorted  (McPherson,  Smith-Lovin,  and  Cook \\n2001). Network cleavages among strong ties \\nare  formed  along  ethnic,  gender,  religious, \\nand social status lines. This finding appears in \\nresearch on romantic relationships (Anderson \\net  al.  2014;  Feliciano,  Robnett,  and  Komaie \\n2009;  Kalmijn  1998;  Lewis  2013;  Potârcă \\nand  Mills  2015),  core  discussion  networks \\n(Marsden  1988;  Smith,  McPherson,  and \\nSmith-Lovin  2014),  and  personal  friendship \\nnetworks  (Currarini,  Jackson,  and  Pin  2010; \\nMouw and Entwisle 2006; Smith, Maas, and \\n\\nVan Tubergen 2014; Vermeij, Van Duijn, and \\nBaerveldt 2009; Wimmer and Lewis 2010).\\n\\nIn contrast to the abundant literature on the \\nsegregation of core networks, little is known \\nabout the segregation of weaker ties, such as \\n\\naUtrecht University\\nbUtrecht University and King Abdulaziz \\nUniversity\\ncUniversity of Michigan\\n\\nCorresponding Author:\\nBas Hofstra, Utrecht University, Department of \\nSociology/ICS, Padualaan 14, 3584 CH Utrecht, \\nthe Netherlands \\nE-mail: b.hofstra@uu.nl\\n\\n\\x0c626   \\n\\nAmerican Sociological Review 82(3) \\n\\nthose  involving  colleagues,  neighbors,  and \\nacquaintances  (DiPrete  et  al.  2011;  Moody \\n2001).  For  various  reasons,  however,  it  is \\nparticularly  important  to  study  segregation \\namong weaker ties, as they relate to a myriad \\nof  sociologically  relevant  issues.  A  classic \\nargument is that such weak ties provide novel \\ninformation on job openings and hence link to \\nlabor-market outcomes and the societal distri-\\nbution  of  wealth  (Granovetter  1973,  1983; \\nLin  1999).  Second,  when  not  only  core  net-\\nworks  but  also  people’s  extended  networks \\nare homogenous—whether in terms of ethnic-\\nity, race, religion, gender, or other character-\\nistics—intergroup trust might be undermined \\n(Fukuyama 1995; Gambetta 1988), and nega-\\ntive intergroup attitudes may prevail, as they \\nare  not  challenged  by  personal  encounters \\n(Allport 1954). A rich body of literature sug-\\ngests that even superficial contact (i.e., weak \\nties)  between  members  of  different  ethnic \\ngroups has the potential to reduce intergroup \\nprejudice  (Pettigrew  and  Tropp  2006).  Fur-\\nthermore,  the  co-evolution  of  homophilous \\nnetwork  selection  and  social  influence  can \\nresult in “echo chambers”—in which people \\nare  increasingly  surrounded  by  like-minded \\npeople  (Halberstam  and  Knight  2016)—and \\nintergroup  polarization  of  opinions  and  atti-\\ntudes (Mäs and Flache 2013).\\n\\nThe  lack  of  research  on  diversity  among \\nweaker ties is mainly due to methodological \\ndifficulties  of  gathering  information  that \\nincludes  both  strong  and  weak  ties.  To  our \\nknowledge,  the  only  study  on  segregation \\namong weak ties is by DiPrete and colleagues \\n(2011).  Using  the  2006  General  Social  Sur-\\nvey  (GSS),  they  found  that  Americans’ \\n“acquaintanceship” networks (i.e., weak ties) \\nare  approximately  as  segregated  as  their \\n“trust” networks (i.e., core ties) along racial, \\npolitical, and religious lines. They measured \\nweak ties using network scale-up methods, in \\nwhich respondents were asked to estimate the \\nnumber  of  people  with  whom  they  are \\nacquainted along racial, ideological, and reli-\\ngious  lines  in  various  contexts  (e.g.,  neigh-\\nborhoods).  This  method  suffers  from  two \\nlimitations.  First,  although  people  are  asked \\n\\nto think about their acquaintances in specific \\ncontexts, there may be selectivity in network \\nrecall ability (Brashears, Hoagland, and Quin-\\ntane  2016).  Second,  the  results  may  be \\naffected  by  social  desirability  biases  or  \\n“misperception or masking of behaviors and \\nopinions that Americans think would be dis-\\napproved  of  by  their  associates”  (DiPrete  et \\nal. 2011:1272).\\n\\nWe propose that the study of online social \\nnetworks provides new opportunities to exam-\\nine the segregation of large personal networks, \\nincluding networks with stronger and weaker \\nties. An important advantage over the scale-up \\nmethod is that online networks map network-\\ning  behavior  up  to  potentially  thousands  of \\ncontacts, without restrictions to specific con-\\ntexts. As such, online networks are less prone \\nto recall bias and other misperceptions.\\n\\nSocial  media  has  experienced  a  remarka-\\nble  rise  to  prominence  over  the  past  decade \\nand is increasingly used to maintain interper-\\nsonal  relationships  (Ellison  and  boyd  2013). \\nInitially,  the  popular  belief  was  that  such \\nplatforms,  of  which  Facebook  is  the  prime \\nexample, “would open up the vista of a social \\nworld that was intrinsically unlimited in size” \\n(Dunbar  et  al.  2015:39).  These  online  net-\\nworks  could  supposedly  be  used  to  mitigate \\nthe  social  segregation  typically  found  in \\noffline friendship networks (Rainie and Well-\\nman 2012; Robinson et al. 2015), as users are \\nnot restricted to exclusively befriending oth-\\ners  from  the  schools  they  attend,  from  the \\nneighborhoods  in  which  they  live,  or  from \\ntheir offline activities.\\n\\nRecent empirical research contradicts such \\nbeliefs  about  the  promise  of  social  media. \\nInstead, this work shows that large online net-\\nworks  are  indicative  of  an  individual’s  com-\\nplete set of offline relationships. For instance, \\nearly  studies  among  U.S.  college  students \\nfound  that  only  .4  percent  of  online  friend-\\nships are online-only (Mayer and Puller 2008), \\nand  college  students  use  online  networks  to \\nmaintain and strengthen their offline relation-\\nships but rarely to initiate new contacts (Elli-\\nson,  Steinfield,  and  Lampe  2007,  2011). \\nMoreover,  80  percent  of  social  network  site \\n\\n\\x0cHofstra et al. \\n\\n627\\n\\nusers state that they use such social platforms \\nto  stay  in  touch  with  their  offline  ties  (Sub-\\nrahmanyam et al. 2008). Similarly, 77 percent \\nof adolescents report that they befriend others \\nonline only when they have met them offline \\n(Reich, Subrahmanyam, and Espinoza 2008). \\nIn a study of Swedish adolescents, 77 percent \\nof friends were friends both offline and online \\n(Van  Zalk  et  al.  2014).  U.S.  adults  indicate \\nthat their online network friends are predomi-\\nnantly family, current and past friends, neigh-\\nbors,  and  colleagues  (Duggan  et  al.  2015). \\nFurthermore, the structure and size of offline \\nand online networks are similar (Dunbar 2016; \\nDunbar et al. 2015). Finally, studies conducted \\namong U.S. college students find similar high \\nlevels of segregation by ethnicity and race on \\nFacebook  as  is  found  on  campuses  (Lewis, \\nGonzalez,  and  Kaufman  2012;  Lewis  et  al. \\n2008;  Mayer  and  Puller  2008;  Wimmer  and \\nLewis 2010).\\n\\nThe  overlap  between  online  and  offline \\nsocial networks provides a number of oppor-\\ntunities  for  sociological  research:  it  enables \\nthe study of a large portion of overall personal \\nnetworks, including small samples of core ties \\nand far larger numbers of weaker ties. Empiri-\\ncally,  it  is  relatively  easy  to  collect  data  on \\nonline  interactions,  such  as  the  data  docu-\\nmented on Facebook, as the platforms gener-\\nate time-stamped, digital footprints of all their \\nusers’ relationships (Golder and Macy 2014).\\nTo illustrate this new approach to the study \\nof  segregation  in  social  networks,  we  con-\\nsider the Facebook networks of adolescents in \\nthe Netherlands. Because prior research shows \\nthat  adolescents’  strong-tie  offline  networks \\nare highly segregated in terms of both ethnic-\\nity (e.g., Baerveldt et al. 2004; Vermeij et al. \\n2009) and gender (e.g., Lubbers 2003; Shrum, \\nCheek, and Hunter 1988; Smith and Schnei-\\nder 2000), we first consider whether we find \\nsimilar patterns of ethnic and gender segrega-\\ntion among the larger number of contacts in \\nonline networks.\\n\\nSecond, we examine the conditions under \\nwhich  ethnic  and  gender  segregation  of  the \\nextended  network  occur.  Because  previous \\nresearch focuses exclusively on tie formation \\n\\nand segregation among core ties, there is little \\nempirical  evidence  of  the  determinants  of \\nsegregation among larger sets of network ties. \\nIn this study, we take the first steps to provide \\nsuch  evidence.  As  our  theoretical  point  of \\ndeparture, we engage classic network theories \\nthat  are  commonly  used  to  explain  segrega-\\ntion  among  core  ties.  Specifically,  we  con-\\nsider  the  role  of  relative  group  size  (Blau \\n1977a, 1977b), foci (Feld 1981, 1982, 1984), \\nhomophily (Byrne 1971; Lazarsfeld and Mer-\\nton 1954), and balance (Heider 1946; Krack-\\nhardt and Handcock 2007), and we show their \\nrelevance  in  explaining  segregation  among \\nhundreds of social relationships. As such, we \\ncontribute  to  the  understanding  of  processes \\nthat  underlie  segregation  in  large  networks \\nwhile simultaneously testing existing, funda-\\nmental hypotheses in novel ways.\\n\\nThird, we explore the differences in segre-\\ngation between core networks and larger net-\\nworks, because some scholars speculate there \\nmay be disparities in segregation among core \\nand weaker ties (e.g., Blackwell and Lichter \\n2004;  Granovetter  1973,  1983;  Mollenhorst, \\nVolker, and Flap 2008; Putnam 2000; Son and \\nLin 2012), although few studies have empiri-\\ncally studied this. Our study is among the first \\nto  elaborate  and  empirically  test  the  condi-\\ntions and mechanisms that create differences \\nin the levels of segregation among core net-\\nworks and larger networks.\\n\\nONliNE SOCiAl NETwORKS\\nWe  used  a  general  survey  of  Dutch  adoles-\\ncents  (Kalter  et  al.  2013,  2015)  and  linked \\nthese  data  to  respondents’  online  Facebook \\nnetworks  in  2014.  In  doing  so,  we  provide \\nnovel and detailed knowledge of respondents, \\ntheir  core  networks,  and  their  larger  online \\nnetworks.  Previous  studies  of  online  social \\nnetwork segregation have used selective sam-\\nples  of  Facebook  friendships  from  U.S.  col-\\nleges  in  2005  and  2006  (Mayer  and  Puller \\n2008; Wimmer and Lewis 2010). At present, \\nFacebook  friends  represent  a  wide  range  of \\nsocial ties, such as family members, friends, \\nand  neighbors,  and  Facebook  is  the  largest \\n\\n\\x0c628   \\n\\nAmerican Sociological Review 82(3) \\n\\nsocial network site worldwide, with approxi-\\nmately  one  billion  daily  users  (Facebook \\n2015).  Among  adolescents  in  the  Nether-\\nlands,  Facebook  is  the  most  popular  social \\nnetwork  site;  over  95  percent  of  Dutch  ado-\\nlescents  have  an  account  (Hofstra,  Corten, \\nand Van Tubergen 2016a).\\n\\nSocial  networks  emerge  on  Facebook \\nwhen  users  send  friendship  invitations  to \\nother  users,  who  can  accept  or  decline  the \\ninvitation.  An  accepted  invitation  shows  an \\nundirected,  reciprocated  friendship  between \\ntwo  users.  On  Facebook,  all  relationships \\ndisplayed on friend lists are indistinguishable \\nwith regard to tie strength (Lewis et al. 2008). \\nNevertheless, considerable evidence suggests \\nthat  the  number  of  “best”  friends  does  not \\nexceed 5 to 10 people. Research also suggests \\nthat a cognitive limit prevents a person from \\nmaintaining  more  than  approximately  five \\nclose relationships (e.g., Dunbar et al. 2015; \\nRoberts  et  al.  2009;  Zhou  et  al.  2005).  In \\naddition,  95  percent  of  Americans  reported \\nfewer  than  six  confidants  (i.e.,  core  ties)  in \\nthe 1984 and 2004 GSS (McPherson, Smith-\\nLovin, and Brashears 2006).1 The average of \\n336  friends  in  our  online  network  data  thus \\nsuggests  that  most  of  the  sample’s  online \\nfriends are weak rather than strong ties. At the \\nvery  least,  we  capture  a  large  portion  of  an \\nindividual’s complete personal network; thus, \\nwe  clearly  go  beyond  the  small  number  of \\ncore social ties. This assumption is supported \\nby estimates suggesting that depending on the \\nmethods  used,  the  average  size  of  overall \\npersonal  networks  range  from  150  (Hill  and \\nDunbar  2003)  to  750  (Zheng,  Salganik,  and \\nGelman 2006) contacts.2\\n\\nTHEORy ANd HypOTHESES\\nA substantial literature examines how offline \\nsocial ties form and why network segregation \\noccurs (e.g., Blau 1977a; Centola 2015; Feld \\n1981;  Kalmijn  1998;  Kossinets  and  Watts \\n2009;  McPherson  et  al.  2001;  Mouw  and \\nEntwisle  2006;  Wimmer  and  Lewis  2010). \\nCommon  explanations  for  the  genesis  of \\nsocial  segregation  are  relative  group  size, \\n\\nfoci,  homophily,  and  balance.  We  therefore \\nfocus on these factors.\\n\\nFollowing Wimmer and Lewis (2010:588), \\nwe use the term homophily for the tie-gener-\\nating  mechanism,  which  indicates  a  prefer-\\nence for the selection of similar friends, and \\nwe  use  the  term  segregation  to  describe  the \\ncomposition of a network. For clarity, we use the \\nterm homophily to indicate what is commonly \\ncalled  “choice”  homophily  (e.g.,  McPherson \\nand  Smith-Lovin  1987;  McPherson  et  al. \\n2001),  that  is,  homophily  net  of  meeting \\nopportunities  or  other  structural  processes \\n(“baseline”  homophily).  In  this  study,  we \\nexamine segregation in social networks with \\nregard to the ethnic and gender homogeneity \\nfound in personal social networks.\\n\\nMeeting Opportunities: Relative \\nGroup Size and Foci\\n\\nTheoretically and empirically, meeting oppor-\\ntunities are important in predicting strong tie \\nformation (e.g., Kalmijn and Flap 2001; Mol-\\nlenhorst, Volker, and Flap 2008, 2014; Mouw \\nand  Entwisle  2006;  Smith,  McPherson,  and \\nSmith-Lovin 2014; Vermeij et al. 2009; Wim-\\nmer and Lewis 2010). Two key dimensions of \\nmeeting opportunities are relative group size \\nand foci (Blau 1977a, 1977b; Feld 1981); we \\nconsider these factors because we expect they \\ndrive segregation in large online networks.\\n\\nRelative group size. The relative size of \\na  group  is  an  important  factor  in  friendship \\nformation  (Blau  1977a,  1977b).  Levels  of \\npersonal network segregation may reflect the \\ndistribution of social categories in a popula-\\ntion. For instance, when a society consists of \\n20 percent minority members and 80 percent \\nmajority members, individuals’ network con-\\ntacts—of  both  majority  and  minority  mem-\\nbers—will consist of 20 percent minority and \\n80 percent majority members under the con-\\ndition of random mixing.\\n\\nIn the Netherlands, ethnic groups’ relative \\nsize  varies,  whereas  the  distribution  of  men \\nand women is approximately 50/50 (Statistics \\nNetherlands 2015). Approximately 79 percent \\n\\n\\x0cHofstra et al. \\n\\n629\\n\\nof  people  are  “Dutch  majority”  members \\n(Statistics Netherlands 2015). In contrast, eth-\\nnic minority groups, who have an immigrant \\nbackground,  are  much  smaller  in  size.  For \\ninstance, minority members with a Moroccan \\nbackground  compose  approximately  3  per-\\ncent of the Dutch population.\\n\\nGiven these differences, we first compare \\nethnic  and  gender  segregation  in  online  net-\\nworks.  If  relative  group  size  is  important  in \\nexplaining segregation, we would expect eth-\\nnic segregation in large personal networks to \\nbe  higher  than  gender  segregation,  as  the \\ndistribution of majority and minority popula-\\ntions is more unequal than the gender distri-\\nbution. Large online networks will thus reflect \\nthese unequal distributions in the population. \\nConsidering  these  disparities  at  the  level  of \\nthe  population  at  large,  we  propose  the  fol-\\nlowing hypothesis:\\n\\nHypothesis  1a:  Larger  online  networks  are \\nmore  homogeneous  by  ethnicity  than  they \\nare by gender.\\n\\nSecond,  we  compare  ethnic  segregation \\nbetween  ethnic  majority  and  minority  mem-\\nbers.  When  people  belong  to  a  large  group, \\nthey have ample opportunities to meet mem-\\nbers of their own group, whereas members of \\nsmaller groups are likely to develop many ties \\noutside  their  own  group  (likely  from  the \\nmajority group). Therefore, we expect ethnic \\nsegregation  in  online  networks  is  higher  for \\nmembers  of  the  Dutch  majority  group  than \\nfor  members  of  an  ethnic  minority. We  thus \\npropose the following hypothesis:\\n\\nHypothesis 1b: Members of the ethnic majority \\nhave  more  homogeneous  online  networks \\nthan do members of the ethnic minority.\\n\\nFoci. Along with groups’ relative size in a \\npopulation, we consider foci and their role in \\nfriendship  formation  (Feld  1981)  and  segre-\\ngation. A  focus  is  defined  as  “a  social,  psy-\\nchological,  legal,  or  physical  entity  around \\nwhich  joint  activities  are  organized”  (Feld \\n1981:1016).  Social  contexts  can  be  repre-\\nfoci  and \\nsented  as  sets  of  different \\n\\nindividuals.  Individuals  engage  in  a  number \\nof  different  foci  but  not  in  all  of  them. Two \\nindividuals who engage in the same focus are \\nthus  more  likely  to  share  activities  than  are \\ntwo  individuals  who  do  not  share  a  focus. \\nSharing  foci  creates  “positive  sentiments \\nindirectly through the generation of positively \\nvalued  interaction”  (Feld  1981:1017).  Foci \\nbring  people  together  in  mutually  rewarding \\nsituations,  and  individuals  form  ties  among \\nothers on whom they spend resources, such as \\ntime and emotions. Sharing a focus therefore \\nincreases the likelihood for a (friendship) tie \\nto emerge (i.e., in the consideration of posi-\\ntive ties).\\n\\nWhat aspects of foci foster dyadic similar-\\nity between individuals? Foci themselves are \\nsegregated because there is selectivity of spe-\\ncific  groups  to  participate  and  enroll  in  par-\\nticular foci (Feld 1981; Feld and Carter 1999). \\nHence,  whereas  a  group’s  size  relative  to \\nother groups is an important factor in friend-\\nship  formation,  these  groups  spread  and \\norganize  in  social  settings  in  a  nonrandom \\nway.  Therefore,  personal  networks  will \\nresemble  the  structural  features  of  foci;  that \\nis,  people  who  develop  ties  within  foci  will \\nlikely resemble one another.\\n\\nMany  empirical  accounts  illustrate  that \\nfoci are segregated. In the United States and \\nEurope,  schools  and  school  classes  vary  in \\ntheir  racial-ethnic  compositions  (Mouw  and \\nEntwisle 2006; Smith, Maas, and Van Tuber-\\ngen 2014; Vermeij et al. 2009), and U.S. and \\nEuropean neighborhoods and cities tend to be \\nracially  and  ethnically  segregated  (Lichter, \\nParisi,  and  Taquino  2015;  Semyonov  and \\nGlikman  2009).  Accordingly,  scholars  have \\nfound  not  only  that  many  relationships  are \\nformed  in  the  context  of  some  sort  of  focus \\n(e.g., Grosetti 2005), but also that homogene-\\nity  in  foci  fosters  segregation  in  personal \\nnetworks (e.g., Feld 1982, 1984; Kalmijn and \\nFlap  2001;  Mollenhorst  et  al.  2014). This  is \\noccasionally  called  “inbreeding”  homophily \\n(McPherson et al. 2001).\\n\\nWe consider schools and classrooms to be \\nmajor  foci  for  tie  formation  among  adoles-\\ncents (McPherson et al. 2001), because ado-\\nlescents spend a considerable amount of their \\n\\n\\x0c630   \\n\\nAmerican Sociological Review 82(3) \\n\\ntime in these settings. These two settings do \\nnot  capture  all  the  foci  of  adolescents,  and \\nparts of the relative group size effect may be \\nattributed to the nonrandom sorting of adoles-\\ncents over foci that we do not capture in this \\nstudy. Nevertheless, not all relationships orig-\\ninate  from  foci,  because  people  may  “meet \\n‘by chance’ or as a result of adjacency along \\nsome continuum” (Feld 1981:1018).\\n\\nFoci effects are often found in segregation \\namong core networks (e.g., Feld 1982, 1984), \\nand  foci  have  similar  effects  on  the  dyadic \\nsimilarity of friend and acquaintanceship net-\\nworks that are measured by name-generating \\nquestions  (Mollenhorst  et  al.  2008).  There-\\nfore, we assume that the foci mechanism does \\nnot  vary  by  tie  strength.  We  thus  derive  the \\nfollowing hypothesis:\\n\\nHypothesis  2:  Ethnic  and  gender  homogeneity \\nin schools and classrooms predicts the ethnic \\nand gender homogeneity of online networks.\\n\\nThe Interplay between Meeting \\nOpportunities, Homophily, and \\nBalance\\n\\nSome  scholars  have  suggested  that  core  net-\\nworks  are  more  strongly  segregated  than  are \\nextended  networks.  Granovetter  (1973:1362), \\nfor example, states that “the stronger the tie con-\\nnecting two individuals, the more similar they \\nare” and “homophilous ties are more likely to be \\nstrong” \\n(Granovetter  1983:210).  Putnam \\n(2000:20) similarly speculates that strong rela-\\ntionships,  which  constitute  “bonding”  social \\ncapital, are more likely to exist among similar \\npeople, whereas weak ties, which create “bridg-\\ning”  social  capital,  are  more  likely  to  exist \\namong  dissimilar  people.  Son  and  Lin \\n(2012:602) argue that people with “stronger ties \\nare more likely to share . . . commonalities” and \\nas ties become weaker, “the ties’ characteristics \\nbecome  dissimilar—more  diverse.”  What  fol-\\nlows  is  an  explanation  of  the  conditions  that \\ncreate differences in homogeneity among stron-\\nger  and  weaker  ties,  with  a  focus  on  meeting \\nopportunities, homophily, and balance.\\n\\nTwo mechanisms suggest that dyadic simi-\\nlarity  correlates  with  tie  strength,  and  hence \\n\\nthat  core  networks  are  more  segregated  than \\nextended networks. The first is the homophily \\nmechanism.  According  to  the  homophily \\nargument, people generally prefer to befriend \\nothers  similar  to  themselves  (Byrne  1971; \\nLazarsfeld and Merton 1954; McPherson et al. \\n2001).  Homophily  exists  along  multiple \\ndimensions,  such  as  gender,  ethnicity,  race, \\neducation, or religion. Individuals may develop \\na psychological preference for similar friends \\n(Byrne  1971),  which  represents  an  enhanced \\ndegree  of  psychological  attraction  between \\ntwo similar entities (Lewis 2015). Homophily \\nmay  be  driven  by  shared  cultural  norms  and \\nbeliefs  (Smith,  Maas,  and  Van  Tubergen \\n2014), because shared norms can decrease the \\ncosts of investing in relationships (it takes less \\ntime to get to know one another) and increase \\nreturns on the investment (it becomes easier to \\ninteract) (Kalmijn 1998).\\n\\nGiven  that  people  have  ample  opportuni-\\nties  to  select  same-gender  and  same-ethnic \\nfriendships,  homophily  may  be  more  pro-\\nnounced among core ties than among weaker \\nties (Mollenhorst et al. 2008). One reason for \\nthis  phenomenon  is  that  stronger  ties  are \\n“costly”  (Windzio  and  Bicer  2013),  because \\nstrong  ties  involve  more  time,  emotional \\nintensity,  intimacy,  and  reciprocal  services \\n(Granovetter 1973:1361), whereas “cheaper,” \\nweaker  ties  deplete  fewer  such  resources. \\nTherefore,  if  possible,  individuals  are  more \\nlikely  to  strengthen  their  relationships  with \\nsimilar  rather  than  dissimilar  others  (Leszc-\\nzensky  and  Pink  2015;  Windzio  and  Bicer \\n2013).  Individuals  perceive  relationships  in \\nwhich  they  share  commonalities  with  others \\nto  be  more  rewarding  and  less  risky.  People \\nexpect stable returns on investments in such \\nrelationships:  it  is  easier  to  interact,  and  it \\ntakes  less  time  to  get  to  know  one  another \\nbecause there are fewer (cultural) boundaries \\nto  overcome.  Hence,  dyadic  similarity  pro-\\nmotes tie strength.\\n\\nThe  second  reason  why  dyadic  similarity \\nwould be associated with tie strength comes \\nfrom \\nthe  network  balance  mechanism. \\nAssuming that similar dyads are more likely \\nto  be  strongly  connected  than  are  dissimilar \\ndyads, triadic closure (when A is friends with \\n\\n\\x0cHofstra et al. \\n\\n631\\n\\nB, and A with C, then B and C are likely to \\nconnect) may occur more often among simi-\\nlar than among dissimilar individuals.3 When \\nties are strong, unbalanced network configu-\\nrations produce psychological strain for actors \\n(Heider 1946), which leads them to close the \\n“forbidden”  triad  (Granovetter  1973).  Fur-\\nthermore,  an  individual  who  has  two  strong \\nties  in  a  triad  provides  opportunities  for  the \\nunconnected pair to befriend each other (Feld \\n1981;  Mollenhorst,  Volker,  and  Flap  2011). \\nAdditionally,  the  dyadic  survival  of  a  rela-\\ntionship  in  an  “isolated  dyad”  is  lower  than \\nthat  of  a  dyad  embedded  in  a  triad,  due  to \\ngroup identity formation, group pressure, and \\nconflict  control.  These  group  dynamics  are \\nmore  likely  to  emerge  within  an  embedded \\ndyad, which creates an increased probability \\nof triadic closure (Feld 1997; Krackhardt and \\nHandcock  2007).  Among  embedded  dyads \\ncharacterized  by  a  strong  relationship,  these \\ndynamics  may  be  even  stronger,  as  these \\nactors  may  more  strongly  call  upon  the \\ngroup’s identity and norms.\\n\\nThe  composition  of  an  individual’s  core \\nfriendship network, which is often limited to \\napproximately  five  persons  (e.g.,  Marsden \\n1988; McPherson et al. 2006; Smith, McPher-\\nson,  and  Smith-Lovin  2014),  may  thus  be \\naffected by homophily and balance, more so \\nthan weaker ties (which are initially formed \\nby  opportunity).  In  the  opportunity  set  of \\nnetwork contacts, a person may have at least \\nfive similar available people with whom rela-\\ntionships  can  be  strengthened.  Individuals’ \\nlarger networks, however, will be more likely \\nto reflect the structural features of the popu-\\nlation and foci. Initially, network ties mirror \\nthe  features  of  meeting  opportunities.  Over \\ntime,  however,  ties  characterized  by  dyadic \\nsimilarity  may  transition  into  stronger  ties, \\nwhereas dissimilar dyads may remain in their \\nexisting  state  of  loosely  connected  weaker \\nties.\\n\\nTo examine this empirically, we first con-\\nsider the number of friends individuals have in \\ntheir  online  network.  We  assume  that  when \\npeople create online social network accounts, \\nthey start by adding close friends and contacts. \\n\\nThis process is similar to name generators, in \\nwhich  people  mention  their  closest  ties  first \\n(Marin  2004).  Additionally,  Facebook  pro-\\nmotes  network  closure:  it  prompts  people  to \\nbecome  friends  with  the  friends  of  their \\nfriends, which also makes it more likely that \\nan individual’s first friends on Facebook will \\nbe  strong  ties.  When  the  number  of  online \\nsocial network friends increases, an increasing \\nnumber of them will likely be weaker ties.\\n\\nThese factors should result in lower levels \\nof  ethnic  and  gender  homogeneity  in  larger \\nonline networks, because the relative number \\nof  strong  ties  is  lower.  However,  we  expect \\nthat  the  negative  association  between  the \\nnumber of online network friends and ethnic \\nhomogeneity  pertains  only  to  members  of \\nethnic  minorities.  The  opportunity  set  of \\npotential  contacts  is  often  shaped  such  that \\nethnic majority members are overrepresented \\nin public life and in foci. Therefore, members \\nof larger ethnic majority groups have limited \\nopportunities to befriend people from smaller \\ngroups:  there  are  fewer  such  persons  in  the \\npopulation  and  in  the  foci.  Among  ethnic \\nmajorities,  this  means  core  networks  and \\nlarger  networks  largely  comprise  majority \\ngroup members. Minority group members, in \\ncontrast, meet many dissimilar others (likely \\nof  the  majority  group).  Although  they  may \\nstrengthen  their  relationships  with  the  few \\nsimilar  minority  members  whom  they  meet \\n(because  of  homophily  and  balance),  their \\nlarger network will continue to resemble the \\nstructural  features  of  the  meeting  opportuni-\\nties.  We  therefore  expect  individuals  with \\nlarger online networks to have lower levels of \\nethnic  and  gender  homogeneity—the  excep-\\ntion  being  ethnic  majority  groups,  as  the \\nopportunities  for  meeting  co-ethnics  are  so \\nwidespread  for  this  group.  Specifically,  we \\npropose the following hypotheses:\\n\\nHypothesis 3a: As online network size increases, \\nethnic  homogeneity  decreases,  but  only \\namong ethnic minorities.\\n\\nHypothesis 3b: As online network size increases, \\n\\ngender homogeneity decreases.\\n\\n\\x0c632   \\n\\nAmerican Sociological Review 82(3) \\n\\nWe also provide a different test of the same \\narguments  by  directly  contrasting  ethnic  and \\ngender  homogeneity  among  small,  self-\\nreported core networks with ethnic and gender \\nhomogeneity  found  in  large  online  personal \\nnetworks. Instead of examining the number of \\nconnections only in online networks, we com-\\npare  core  and  large  online  networks  directly. \\nWe thus hypothesize the following:\\n\\nHypothesis 3c: Core networks have more eth-\\nnic homogeneity than do larger online net-\\nworks, but only among ethnic minorities.\\n\\nHypothesis 3d: Core networks are more gender \\nhomogeneous than the larger online networks.\\n\\ndATA ANd MEASURES\\n\\nWe  use  the  second  wave  of  survey  data  on \\nadolescents in the Netherlands, which is part \\nof  a  larger  project  titled  “Children  of  Immi-\\ngrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European \\nCountries”  (CILS4EU)  (Kalter  et  al.  2013, \\n2015).4 Although  data  were  collected  in  the \\nNetherlands,  Sweden,  Germany,  and  Eng-\\nland,  the  measures  we  are  interested  in  are \\nincluded only in the Dutch data. In the CIL-\\nS4EU,  adolescents  age  14  to  15  years  were \\nfollowed  for  three  years,  starting  in  2010, \\nwith a one-year time lag. The survey included \\ndata on many individual characteristics, atti-\\ntudes,  and  information  about  the  individuals \\nwith  whom  respondents  associated  with  in \\ntheir leisure time. The survey also contained \\nsociometric data on friendships within class-\\nrooms (~22 pupils in a classroom). The sam-\\nple  was  stratified  by  the  proportion  of \\nnon-Western  immigrants  within  a  school. \\nWithin these strata, schools were chosen with \\na probability proportional to their size (based \\non the number of pupils at the relevant educa-\\ntional level).\\n\\nIn wave 1 (2010 to 2011), two classes were \\nrandomly selected within the schools, which \\nresulted  in  118  schools,  252  classes,  and \\n4,963  Dutch  pupils  participating  in  the  sur-\\nvey.5 Because changes in class compositions \\n\\nbetween  grades  are  common  in  the  Nether-\\nlands,  respondents  were  distributed  among \\ndifferent classes in wave 2 (2011 to 2012) that \\nwere not part of the original sampling frame. \\nTo ensure that many wave 1 pupils also par-\\nticipated  in  wave  2,  schools  were  asked  to \\ninclude  more  than  the  two  classes  initially \\nsampled  in  wave  1  when  respondents  from \\nwave 1 were in classes other than the previ-\\nously  sampled  classes.  Consequently,  2,118 \\nnew  pupils  were  interviewed,  and  3,803  of \\nwave  1  respondents  were  surveyed  again  in \\nwave 2 (76.6 percent; total N = 5,921). We used \\nthe second wave of the CILS4EU because it is \\nthe latest licensed data including sociometric \\nclassroom information.\\n\\nThe Dutch Facebook Survey\\n\\nThe  Dutch  Facebook  Survey  (DFS)  enriched \\nthe Dutch part of the CILS4EU survey (Hofs-\\ntra,  Corten,  and  Van  Tubergen  2015).6  Data \\nwere  collected  between  June  and  September \\n2014. Of the 4,864 respondents who indicated \\nFacebook  membership  in  wave  3  (2012  to \\n2013;  N  =  3,423)  or  4  (2013  to  2014;  N  = \\n3,595) of the CILS4EU, 4,463 were tracked on \\nFacebook. For respondents who kept a public \\nfriend  list,  we  downloaded  their  complete \\nFacebook  friend  lists  (N  =  3,252;  72.8  per-\\ncent).  There  is  selectivity  in  the  downloaded \\nfriend  lists:  some  respondents  kept  their  lists \\nprivate,  others  kept  public  friend  lists.  Girls, \\nethnic minority members, and unpopular ado-\\nlescents  are  somewhat  underrepresented, \\nbecause  they  more  often  keep  private  friend \\nlists  (Hofstra,  Corten,  and  Van  Tubergen \\n2016b).  Various  Heckman  selection-model \\nspecifications (Heckman 1979) show that our \\nresults are insensitive to these selection biases.7 \\nThe 3,252 respondents have a combined total \\nof 1,158,227 friends, and 2,810 (86.4 percent) \\nof the respondents whose complete friend list \\nwe downloaded also participated in wave 2 of \\nthe CILS4EU.8 This is the number of respon-\\ndents  for  whom  we  present  results.9  Table  1 \\nsummarizes the data sources and our method \\nof arriving at the final number of respondents.\\n\\n\\x0cHofstra et al. \\n\\n633\\n\\nTable 1.

We predicted friends’ gender and ethnic \\nbackground  based  on  their  first  names,10 \\nusing the Dutch Civil Registration data (here-\\nafter, DCR) for the entire Dutch population in \\n2010  (N  =  15,785,208;  Bloothooft  and \\nSchraagen 2011). We obtained (1) the fraction \\nof the name carriers and (2) the fraction of the \\nname  carriers’  fathers  and  (3)  mothers  who \\nwere  born  in  the  Netherlands,  Turkey, \\nMorocco, the Dutch Caribbean, other Western \\ncountries,  or  other  non-Western  countries. \\nAdditionally,  we  obtained  the  percentage  of \\nwomen among the name carriers.\\n\\nWe matched first names in the DCR to first \\nnames  in  the  second  wave  of  the  CILS4EU \\nsurvey as a training dataset. In the CILS4EU, \\nwe measured respondents’ ethnic background \\nby classifying them into one of the six largest \\nethnic groups in the Netherlands (Castles, De \\nHaas,  and  Miller  2013):  Dutch  majority, \\nTurkish,  Moroccan,  Dutch  Caribbean,  other \\nWestern (European or English speaking), and \\nother  non-Western.  Moroccan  and  Turkish \\nadolescents  are  children  of  immigrants  from \\nthe \\nthat  was \\nrecruited by the Netherlands in the 1950s and \\n1960s. Dutch Caribbean adolescents originate \\nfrom  post-colonial  countries  in  the  Dutch \\n\\nlow-educated \\n\\nlabor  force \\n\\nCaribbean (e.g., Aruba and Suriname). West-\\nern  and  non-Western  adolescents  originate \\nfrom neighboring countries such as Germany \\nor  conflict  areas  such  as Afghanistan;  these \\nimmigrant groups are relatively similar across \\nWestern  European  countries  (Smith,  Maas, \\nand Van Tubergen 2014).\\n\\nWe  classified  respondents  according  to \\ntheir  biological  parents’  country  of  birth, \\nwhich  is  standard  practice  in  research  on \\nDutch  ethnic  minority  groups  (cf.  Smith, \\nMaas,  and  Van  Tubergen  2014;  Stark  and \\nFlache 2012; Vermeij et al. 2009). When stu-\\ndents  have  one  parent  who  was  born  in  the \\nNetherlands, the student is classified into the \\nethnic background of the parent who was not \\nborn in the Netherlands; if a student’s parents \\nwere  born  in  different  non-Dutch  countries, \\nthe  student  is  classified  according  to  the \\nmother’s birth country. This definition is reg-\\nularly applied and used by Statistics Nether-\\nlands (Statistics Netherlands 2012).\\n\\nCombining the DCR and the CILS4EU, we \\ndeveloped  an  algorithm  to  estimate  gender \\nand ethnic segregation based on people’s first \\nnames, which yields high correlations between \\nthe predicted and actual ethnicity and gender \\n(this method is outlined in Part A of the online \\nsupplement). We calculated the percentage of \\nwomen and the percentage of each of the six \\nethnicities  in  respondents’  online  networks. \\nFor each respondent, we assigned the percent-\\nage  of  same-gender  friendships  (i.e.,  the \\n\\n\\x0c634   \\n\\nAmerican Sociological Review 82(3) \\n\\npercentage of women for girls and percentage \\nof  men  for  boys)  in  their  online  networks.11 \\nFinally, we assigned each respondent the per-\\ncentage  of  co-ethnic  ties  in  their  online  net-\\nworks (e.g., the percentage of Dutch majority \\nmembers  among  online  network  friends  for \\nthe Dutch majority adolescents).\\n\\nHomogeneity in Core Friendship \\nNetworks\\n\\nWave  2  of  the  CILS4EU  has  two  measures \\nthat  capture  ethnic  homogeneity  and  one \\nmeasure that captures gender homogeneity in \\ncore  friendship  networks:  a  name  generator \\nfor the five best friends in general (only for \\nethnicity), and a name generator for the five \\nbest friends in class (not necessarily the same \\nfriends as the former).\\n\\nFirst,  we  measured  the  actual  number  of \\nfriends  of  Dutch,  Turkish,  Moroccan,  Dutch \\nCaribbean, or another ethnic background using \\na name-generator question. Respondents could \\nnominate their best friends (with a maximum \\nof five) and provide ethnic background infor-\\nmation.  From  these  data,  we  calculated  the \\npercentage of co-ethnic friends among all the \\nclose friends (co-ethnicFRIENDS IN GENERAL). We \\nconsider ethnically similar friends among best \\nfriends in general. Respondents may be more \\naccurate  in  reporting  ethnicities  of  ethnically \\nsimilar than ethnically dissimilar friends. Fur-\\nthermore, respondents were asked to report the \\nethnicities  of  their  best  friends.  Respondents \\nmay  more  accurately  report  the  ethnicities  of \\ntheir best friends than those of acquaintances. \\nTherefore,  respondents’  misreporting  of \\nalter  characteristics  is  likely  reduced  to  a \\nminimum.\\n\\nSecond,  we  measured  the  number  of  best \\nfriends in a class (with a maximum of five) who \\nwere  girls  (which  is  the  only  core-network \\nmeasure available for measuring gender homo-\\ngeneity) and those who were of Dutch, Turkish, \\nMoroccan, Dutch Caribbean, other Western, or \\nother non-Western ethnic backgrounds. We cal-\\nculated the percentage of co-ethnic friends and \\nthe  percentage  of  same-gender  friends  among \\nall  friends  in  a  class  (co-ethnicFRIENDS  IN  CLASS \\n\\nand same-genderFRIENDS IN CLASS). Because these \\nfriends  themselves  were  respondents  in  the \\nsurvey, they self-reported their gender and eth-\\nnicity. We constructed gender and ethnic homo-\\ngeneity  with  respect  to  best  friends  in  a  class \\nwith these self-reports, and hence they do not \\nsuffer  from  respondents’  misperceptions  in \\nalter characteristics.\\n\\nHomogeneity in Meeting \\nOpportunities and Number of Online \\nNetwork Friends\\nWe  constructed  various  measures  to  capture \\nethnic  and  gender  homogeneity  in  two  ado-\\nlescent  opportunity  structures,  the  class  and \\nthe  school.  First,  using  the  CILS4EU,  we \\nmeasured the number of classmates who are \\nfemale  and  those  with  the  six  ethnic  back-\\ngrounds  mentioned  above,  excluding  best \\nfriends  who  are  mentioned  in  the  class  and \\nrespondents  themselves.  We  calculated  the \\npercentage  of  same-gender  and  co-ethnic \\nclassmates,  and  we  excluded  the  respondent \\nand the number of best friends who are men-\\ntioned. We excluded best friends because they \\nare  included  in  the  core-network  measure, \\nand  we  do  not  want  to  double-count  best \\nfriends  across  variables. With  this  approach, \\nwe  are  better  able  to  separate  the  effects \\nbetween  variables  (same-genderIN  CLASS  and \\nco-ethnicIN CLASS).\\n\\nSecond,  we  measured  the  number  of \\nfemale  pupils  in  a  school  (aggregated  from \\nthe  classes  surveyed)  and  the  number  of \\npupils  in  the  school  from  a  Dutch,  Turkish, \\nMoroccan,  Dutch  Caribbean,  other  Western, \\nor  other  non-Western  ethnic  background \\n(measured  from  secondary  data  obtained \\nfrom the Dutch inspectorate), excluding best \\nfriends who are mentioned, other classmates, \\nand  the  respondent.  We  calculated  the  per-\\ncentage of same-gender schoolmates (exclud-\\ning the respondent, the number of best friends \\nwho are mentioned, and the number of class-\\nmates) (same-genderIN SCHOOL). We also meas-\\nured the percentage of co-ethnic schoolmates \\n(excluding the respondent, the number of best \\nfriends,  and \\nthe  number  of  classmates)  \\n\\n\\x0cHofstra et al. \\n\\n635\\n\\n(co-ethnicIN SCHOOL). We measured these two \\nvariables using the CILS4EU.\\n\\nWe  also  calculated  the  number  of  online \\nnetwork friends from respondents’ Facebook \\nfriend lists using the DFS. The distribution of \\nthe number of online network friends, if it is \\nplotted,  strongly  resembles  the  distribution \\nplot  reported  by  DiPrete  and  colleagues \\n(2011:1254) of the number of acquaintances \\nreported by Americans.\\n\\nKinship Ties in Online Networks as a \\nConfounding Factor\\n\\nAn issue with online versus offline friendship \\nnetworks is that we restricted respondents to \\nname  friends  in  their  self-reported  core  net-\\nworks  offline,  whereas  Facebook  networks \\nlikely  include  kin.  Therefore,  when  we  con-\\ntrast core networks with online networks, we \\ncompare  two  data  sources  of  different  sam-\\npling frames. Kinship ties in online networks \\nmight pull ethnic and gender homogeneity in \\ndifferent directions. Kin likely have a similar \\nethnicity as the respondent, whereas the gen-\\nder  distribution  in  families  is  likely  to  be \\n50/50. On the one hand, the presence of kin in \\nonline  networks  overestimates  ethnic  homo-\\ngeneity; on the other hand, the presence of kin \\namong  Facebook  friends  might  lead  us  to \\nunderestimate  gender  homogeneity  (see \\nMcPherson et al. 2001:431).\\n\\nWe identify kinship ties in online networks \\nin two ways, using the DFS. First, Facebook \\nallows members to show kinship tags on their \\nprofiles.  We  tracked  the  number  of  kinship \\ntags on Facebook profiles and calculated the \\npercentage  of  kinship  tags  in  the  Facebook \\nnetwork (mean = 1.1 percent). We considered \\nrealistic  tags  (e.g.,  no  granddaughters,  given \\nthat we study adolescents). Individuals might \\nnot  tag  each  family  member  on  Facebook. \\nTherefore,  we  calculated  the  percentage  of \\nfriends in the Facebook network who share a \\nsurname  with  the  respondent  (mean  =  1.7 \\npercent). Non-kin friends may have a similar \\nsurname,  which  makes  our  analyses  more \\nconservative,  because  individuals  with  simi-\\nlar surnames are likely of the same ethnicity. \\n\\nNevertheless, we may miss kin in online net-\\nworks who are not tagged and who have dif-\\nferent  surnames.  We  mention  where  we \\nremove kin from the online networks to avoid \\nsampling  mismatches  (descriptive  compari-\\nsons  between  core  networks  and  the  larger \\nonline  networks)  and  where  we  control  for \\nthese  two  variables  (statistical  tests  of  the \\nhypotheses).12\\n\\nTable 2 shows the descriptive statistics for \\nethnic  and  gender  homogeneity  in  the  large \\nonline  networks  (including  kin),  core  net-\\nworks, opportunity structures, and kinship ties \\nin online networks, along with the distributions \\nof boys and girls and ethnic groups in the data.\\n\\nAdditional Confounding Factors\\n\\nWe adjust for the year in which respondents \\njoined  Facebook  using  the  DFS  (median  = \\n2010).  Respondents  who  were  members  for \\nshorter periods may have been more selective \\nin their online network friendships. Facebook \\nmembership  duration  and  the  number  of \\nFacebook  friends  are  positively  correlated  \\n(r = .250; p < .001).\\n\\nUsing  the  CILS4EU,  we  also  control  for \\neducational  track  in  high  school,  because \\nsuch  a  track  may  be  related  to  ethnic  preju-\\ndice (Lancee and Sarrasin 2015). When ado-\\nlescents  transition  to  high  school  in  the \\nNetherlands,  they  are  placed  into  different \\ntracks, which differ in their level and type of \\neducation.  We  measured  this  categorization \\nusing  three  dummy  variables:  preparatory \\nvocational  education  (N  =  1,358;  Dutch: \\nVMBO),  senior  general  (N  =  750;  Dutch: \\nHAVO), and university preparatory education \\n(N = 586; Dutch: VWO). We also control for \\nrespondents’ social attractiveness, which may \\nbe  correlated  with  ethnicity  (Wimmer  and \\nLewis 2010). We measured social attractive-\\nness by popularity (i.e., incoming popularity \\nnominations from other classmates) (mean = \\n9.357; SD = 14.566). We calculated popular-\\nity by dividing the total number of classmates’ \\nreceived  nominations  for  popularity  by  the \\ntotal  number  of  students  in  the  class  minus \\none multiplied by 100.13\\n\\n\\x0c636   \\n\\nAmerican Sociological Review 82(3) \\n\\nTable 2.

With  the  survey \\nquestion,  “Please  rate  how  you  feel  towards \\nthe  following  groups…”  respondents  used  a \\nscale ranging from 0 (negative) to 100 (posi-\\ntive),  with  10-point  intervals,  to  rate  how \\npositively they feel toward groups of Dutch, \\nTurkish, Moroccan, and Dutch Caribbean eth-\\nnic backgrounds. We constructed ethnic out-\\ngroup attitudes by taking the mean positivity \\nscore—on a scale from 0 to 10—of respond-\\nents’ answers to this question while excluding \\nthe  respondent’s  own  ethnic  group  (mean  = \\n\\n5.011;  SD  =  1.997). This  variable  is  signifi-\\ncantly negatively related to the percentage of \\nco-ethnic friends online (r = –.213; p < .001).\\nWe  accounted  for  respondents’  attitudes \\ntoward gender roles when we considered gen-\\nder homogeneity in online networks. We cap-\\ntured  respondents’  progressiveness  toward \\ngender roles by counting (from zero to four) \\nhow  many  times  respondents  indicated  that \\nboth  men  and  women  (instead  of  men  or \\nwomen)  should  take  care  of  children,  cook, \\nearn money, and clean (Davis and Greenstein \\n2009) (α = .73; mean = 2.689; SD = 1.352). \\nis  significantly  negatively \\nThis  variable \\n\\n\\x0cHofstra et al. \\n\\n637\\n\\nTable 3.

If everyone connected at random on \\nFacebook  in  the  Netherlands,  the  average \\npersonal network would consist of 78.6 per-\\ncent  Dutch,  2.4  percent  Turks,  2.2  percent \\nMoroccans, 2.9 percent Dutch Caribbean, 9.5 \\npercent  other  Western  individuals,  and  4.3 \\npercent  individuals  with  other  non-Western \\nethnic  backgrounds.  However,  on  average, \\nthe online networks in our sample consist of \\n86.2  percent  Dutch,  2.3  percent  Turks,  1.7 \\npercent Moroccans, 1.4 percent Dutch Carib-\\nbean,  3.2  percent  other  Western  individuals, \\nand  4.2  percent  individuals  with  other  non-\\nWestern backgrounds (see Table 2).\\n\\nTable 3 shows the ethnic homogeneity of \\ncore networks and online networks, and Table \\n4 shows these results broken down by ethnic-\\nity (both tables exclude kinship ties in online \\nnetworks).  The  percentage  of  co-ethnic \\nfriends online is 76 percent; in core networks \\nit  is  76.2  percent  for  friends  in  general  (co-\\nethnicFRIENDS IN GENERAL) and 67.5 percent for \\nfriends  in  a  class  (co-ethnicFRIENDS  IN  CLASS). \\nThe  correlations  between  co-ethnic  friend-\\nships  in  core  and  larger  online  networks  are \\nhigh:  .784  (co-ethnicFRIENDS  IN  GENERAL)  and \\n.677 (co-ethnicFRIENDS IN CLASS). Dutch major-\\nity members have the highest ethnic homoge-\\nneity online, 91.7 percent (co-ethnicFACEBOOK), \\nwhich  resembles  the  homogeneity  in  core \\nnetworks  (co-ethnicFRIENDS  IN  GENERAL  =  88.4 \\n\\npercent). The ethnic homogeneity of Turkish \\nadolescents  (co-ethnicFACEBOOK  =  40.6  per-\\ncent) is slightly higher than that of Moroccan \\nadolescents  (co-ethnicFACEBOOK  =  28.5  per-\\ncent).  Ethnic  homogeneity in online networks \\n(~336  friends)  mirrors  ethnic  homogeneity  in \\ncore networks (~5 friends).\\n\\nTable 5 shows the gender homogeneity of \\ncore  networks  and  online  networks  broken \\ndown by gender (excluding kinship ties). On \\naverage, respondents have 56.3 percent same-\\ngender  friendships  online.  If  everyone  con-\\nnected at random, such that the percentage of \\nsame-gender friendships on Facebook reflected \\nthe  gender  composition  at  the  societal  level, \\nthis number should be approximately 50 per-\\ncent  (Statistics  Netherlands  2015).  On  aver-\\nage,  adolescents \\nreported  83.2  percent \\nsame-gender  friends  in  a  class.  Boys  had \\nslightly more same-gender friendships online \\nthan  did  girls  (boys  =  57.1  percent;  girls  = \\n55.5 percent), but boys had approximately the \\nsame  percentage  of  same-gender  friendships \\nin  a  class  as  did  girls  (boys  =  83  percent;  \\ngirls = 83.4 percent).\\n\\nMeeting Opportunities: Relative \\nGroup Size and Foci\\n\\nRelative group size. We begin by examining the \\nrole  of  relative  group  size  in  homogeneity  in \\nonline networks. We first evaluate the extent to \\nwhich ethnic and gender homogeneity estimates \\nin  online  networks  differ  from  one  another \\n(Hypothesis 1a).

We specified sev-\\neral multilevel regression models in order to \\nestimate the percentage of same-ethnic friends \\nwithin  respondents’  online  networks.18,19,20 \\nWe delete the missing values of the variables \\npresented in these analyses listwise and lose \\n9.1 percent (N = 261) of cases in the analyses. \\nThese models can be specified as follows:\\n\\nY\\nijk\\n\\n=\\n\\nβ\\n\\n000\\n\\n+\\n\\nβ\\n\\n00x\\n\\nX\\n\\ni\\n\\n+\\n\\ns\\n0\\n\\nk\\n\\n+\\n\\nc\\n0\\n\\njk\\n\\n+\\n\\np\\n0\\n\\nijk\\n\\n   (2)\\n\\nwhere  Yijk  is  the  percentage  of  co-ethnic \\nfriendships  in  the  online  network  for  pupil  i \\nfrom  class  j  and  school  k;  s k0 ,  c jk0\\n, \\nand  β000  specify similar terms as in Equation \\n1;  and  β00x   is  a  vector  for  the  independent \\nvariables at the pupil level (e.g., ethnic back-\\nground).

Density Plots of Ethnic and Gender Homogeneity in Large Online Networks\\n\\nonline for all respondents and separately for \\nDutch majority and ethnic minority members \\n(while  controlling  for  kinship  ties  in  the \\nonline networks).\\n\\nWe find relatively large effects of ethnicity \\non  ethnic  homogeneity  in  online  networks \\n(while controlling for ethnic homogeneity in the \\nclass and school setting). Dutch majority-group \\nadolescents  seem  to  have  at  least  31  percent \\nmore co-ethnic friendships online than do stu-\\ndents  of  other  ethnic  backgrounds  (p  <  .001). \\nFor  instance,  adolescents  of  Moroccan  ethnic \\nbackground have 43.5 percent fewer, and those \\nof Turkish descent 31.8 percent fewer, co-ethnic \\nonline  networks  friendships  than  do  Dutch \\nmajority  members.  Among  ethnic  minority \\nmembers,  students  of  Turkish  ethnic  back-\\nground  exhibit  more  ethnic  segregation  in \\nonline  networks  than  do  all  of  their  ethnic \\nminority counterparts: they have at least 9 per-\\ncent more co-ethnic friends in their online net-\\nworks  (p  <  .01).  These  variables  reflect  the \\npropinquity of co-ethnic individuals in the pop-\\nulation and relate to co-ethnic friendships in the \\nlarge  online  networks.  The  results  thus  show \\nthat the larger majority group has significantly \\nhigher  levels  of  ethnic  homogeneity  than  do \\nethnic minority group members (consistent with \\nHypothesis 1b).\\n\\nFoci. We now consider the extent to which \\nthe homogeneity of foci relates to homogene-\\nity  in  online  networks.  We  ask  whether  the \\npercentage  of  co-ethnic  and  same-gender \\npeers in class and in school is related to homo-\\ngeneity in online networks (Hypothesis 2). In \\naddition  to  the  results  shown  in  Table  6,  we \\nestimated a multilevel regression for the per-\\ncentage  of  same-gender  ties  in  online  net-\\nworks. This model takes the form of Equation \\n2,  but  here,  Yijk  specifies  the  percentage  of \\nsame-gender friendships online. We delete the \\nmissing values of the variables presented list-\\nwise in this analysis and lose 7.8 percent (N = \\n212) of the cases. Table 7 shows results of this \\nmodel (with kinship ties as control variables).\\nTable 6 shows that a two-standard-deviation \\nincrease in the percentage of co-ethnic class-\\nmates  increases  the  percentage  of  co-ethnic \\nfriends online by 2.1 percent ( p < .01). This \\nrelationship  seems  to  be  driven  by  Dutch \\nmajority  members,  because  this  variable  is \\nstatistically  significant  for  majority  members  \\n(p < .05) but not for ethnic minority members  \\n(p > .05). Additionally, the percentage of co-\\nethnic schoolmates is associated with the per-\\ncentage of co-ethnic friends in online networks \\nfor all respondents.

We \\ncan now compare the difference in ethnic and \\ngender  homogeneity  between  strong  versus \\nweaker  ties  (Hypotheses  3c  and  3d).  Before \\ndoing that, we first consider the relationship \\nbetween network size and ethnic and gender \\nhomogeneity in online networks (Hypotheses \\n3a and 3b).21\\n\\nTable 6 shows that ethnic minority adoles-\\ncents  who  have  larger  online  networks  also \\nhave a lower percentage of co-ethnic friends. \\nFor each 100 extra online network friends, the \\npercentage of co-ethnic friends decreases by \\n.7 percent. A two-standard-deviation increase \\nin  the  number  of  friends  decreases  the  per-\\ncentage  of  co-ethnic  online  network  friends \\nby  approximately  2.5  percent.  For  majority-\\ngroup adolescents, the number of friends and \\nthe  percentage  of  co-ethnic  friends  are  not \\nrelated  (p  >  .05).  The  negative  association \\nbetween  the  number  of  friends  and  the  per-\\ncentage  of  co-ethnic  friends  is  significantly \\nstronger for minority members than for Dutch \\nmajority adolescents (p < .001; tested as the \\nproduct of a dichotomous variable for Dutch/\\nnon-Dutch ethnic background and the number \\nof friends). This result suggests that a larger \\nonline  network  coincides  with  lower  ethnic \\nhomogeneity  only  among  ethnic  minority \\nmembers (consistent with Hypothesis 3a).\\n\\nTable  7  shows  that  when  the  number  of \\nonline  network  friends  increases,  gender \\nhomogeneity decreases. A two-standard-deviation \\nincrease  in  the  number  of  online  network \\nfriends decreases the percentage of same-gen-\\nder  friends  online  by  5.7  percent  (p  <  .001), \\nwhich  suggests  that  gender  homogeneity  is \\nstronger among smaller online networks than \\namong  larger  online  networks  (consistent \\nwith Hypothesis 3b).\\n\\nFigures  2  and  3  depict  the  relationships \\nbetween network size and ethnic and gender \\nhomogeneity  in  online  networks.  Figure  2 \\n\\nshows that the percentage of co-ethnic friend-\\nships  online  decreases  when  the  number  of \\nfriends  online  increases  for  ethnic  minority \\nadolescents. For ethnic minority adolescents, \\nthe  number  of  friends  in  online  networks  is \\nnegatively  correlated  with  the  percentage  of \\nco-ethnic friends online (r = –.343; p < .001). \\nFigure 3 shows that network size and the per-\\ncentage of same-gender friendships in online \\nnetworks  is  negatively  correlated  for  both \\nboys and girls (r = –.312; p < .001).\\n\\nSelf-reported core networks and online \\nnetworks. Next, we contrast ethnic and gender \\nhomogeneity  in  self-reported  core  networks \\nand larger online networks (Hypothesis 3c). To \\ndo so, we subtract ethnic homogeneity in online \\nnetworks  from  ethnic  homogeneity  among \\nfriends  in  general  (co-ethnicFRIENDS  IN  GENERAL \\n– co-ethnicFACEBOOK; results do not vary if we \\nuse  co-ethnicFRIENDS  IN  CLASS)  and  estimate  the \\ndifferences across ethnic groups between these \\nfactors  in  a  multilevel  regression  model  (see \\nTable A2 in the Appendix). Members of minor-\\nity  groups  have  at  least  26  percent  more  co-\\nethnic  friends  among  their  core  friends  than \\namong  their  online  network  friends  than  do \\nDutch  majority  members  (p  <  .001;  we \\nexcluded  self-reported  core  networks  because \\nthese are part of the dependent variable in this \\nmodel).  Hence,  we  find  evidence  supporting \\nour  argument  that  ethnic  minority  members \\nhave  higher  levels  of  ethnic  homogeneity  in \\ntheir  core  networks  than  in  their  larger  net-\\nworks, whereas we find no such association for \\nethnic majority members.\\n\\nWe also consider whether gender homogene-\\nity in core networks is higher than in online net-\\nworks (Hypothesis 3d). We estimate a multilevel \\nmodel where the dependent variable is the differ-\\nence  between  the  percentage  of  same-gender \\nfriends in the core and online networks (same-\\ngenderFACEBOOK  –  same-genderFRIENDS  IN  CLASS). \\nThe intercept statistically deviates from zero \\n(intercept = 29.995; p < .001; see Table A3 in \\nthe  Appendix;  we  excluded  core  networks \\nbecause these are part of the dependent vari-\\nable), which suggests that gender homogene-\\nity  among  core  ties,  as  measured  from  the \\nsurvey,  is  approximately  30  percent  higher \\nthan gender homogeneity in online networks, \\n\\n\\x0c644   \\n\\nAmerican Sociological Review 82(3) \\n\\nFigure 2.

The \\ndesignation of gender homogeneity in classes \\nand  school  as  covariates  does  not  explain \\naway  the  difference.  This  finding  suggests \\nthat, compared to larger online networks, smaller \\ncore networks tend to be more gender homo-\\ngeneous (consistent with Hypothesis 3d).\\n\\nConfounding Factors\\n\\nWe examined these differences while adjusting \\nfor a variety of factors, as shown in Tables 6 \\nand  7.  Although  the  percentage  of  co-ethnic \\nonline network friends does not differ signifi-\\ncantly  between  girls  and  boys,  girls  have \\n\\n\\x0cHofstra et al. \\n\\n645\\n\\nslightly fewer same-gender online ties than do \\nboys.  Turkish  minority  members  also  have \\nsignificantly  more  same-gender  online  net-\\nwork friendships than do Dutch majority mem-\\nbers. Furthermore, ethnic minority adolescents \\nwho are more highly educated have fewer co-\\nethnic online network friendships than do their \\nless-educated  counterparts,  and  students  in  a \\nsenior  general  educational  track  have  more \\nsame-gender ties online than do students in the \\nlowest  educational  track.  The  percentage  of \\nco-ethnic  friends  in  general  and  same-gender \\nfriends in a class is also positively associated \\nwith ethnic and gender homogeneity in online \\nnetworks. Dutch majority members who have \\nmore positive ethnic out-group attitudes have \\nfewer  co-ethnic  friends  online  (implying  that \\nthey  are  more  likely  to  connect  to  minority \\nmembers),  and  adolescents  who  hold  more \\nprogressive  gender  role  attitudes  have  fewer \\nsame-gender  friends  online.  Finally,  adoles-\\ncents  who  have  more  friends  in  their  online \\nnetworks  with  the  same  surnames  have  a \\nhigher  percentage  of  co-ethnic  friends  online \\n(consistent with the idea that kin ties increase \\nethnic homogeneity).\\n\\nCONClUSiONS ANd \\ndiSCUSSiON\\nWe aimed to answer three key questions that \\nare unresolved in the literature on segregation \\nin social networks: How high are segregation \\nlevels in large online networks? Under what \\nconditions  does  this  segregation  occur? And \\nhow can we explain disparities in segregation \\nbetween core and larger networks? We show \\nthat  digital  footprint  data  from  online  social \\nnetworks, specifically Facebook, can be used \\nto obtain novel and robust tests of predictions \\nderived from seminal theories of the determi-\\nnants of segregation in personal networks.\\n\\nThe answer to our first question is that we \\nfind high levels of ethnic segregation in online \\nnetworks. Averaged  over  all  respondents,  we \\nfind \\nthree-quarters  of \\nrespondents’ Facebook friends are of a similar \\nethnic  background.  This  ratio  is  on  par  with \\nethnic  homogeneity \\nin  core  networks. \\n\\nthat  approximately \\n\\nHowever, if we split these estimates by ethnic \\ngroup, only majority members’ core and online \\nnetworks are equally ethnically homogeneous, \\nwhereas minority members have lower levels \\nof ethnic homogeneity in their online than in \\ntheir core networks. Slightly more than half of \\nonline networks friends are the same gender as \\nrespondents, whereas in the core networks, the \\nratio was well above 80 percent.\\n\\nSecond,  under  what  conditions  do  these \\npatterns  of  segregation  occur  in  online  net-\\nworks?  In  the  tradition  of  Blau  (1977a, \\n1977b),  Feld  (1981),  and  others  who  have \\nstudied  the  role  of  meeting  opportunities  in \\nthe  genesis  of  core  ties  (e.g.,  Kalmijn  and \\nFlap 2001; Mouw and Entwisle 2006; Wim-\\nmer and Lewis 2010), we found that relative \\ngroup size and social foci are strongly associ-\\nated with segregation in larger personal net-\\nworks.  Specifically,  large  networks  tend  to \\nmirror  the  structural  features  of  the  popula-\\ntion  and  foci.  The  gender  distribution  in  a \\npopulation is often 50/50, whereas the distri-\\nbution  of  ethnicities  is  much  more  unequal. \\nTherefore,  we  hypothesized  and  confirmed \\nthat gender homogeneity is lower than ethnic \\nhomogeneity  in  online  networks.  Because \\nethnic majority members have more opportu-\\nnities  to  meet  similar  others,  we  expected, \\nand  found,  that  ethnic  majority  members, \\ncompared  to  ethnic  minorities,  have  higher \\nlevels  of  ethnic  homogeneity  in  their  large \\npersonal  networks.  Groups  in  society  segre-\\ngate over foci and the ties that emerge within \\nthem  (Feld  1981).  Therefore,  personal  net-\\nworks  resemble  the  levels  of  segregation  of \\nfoci.  We  thus  hypothesized,  and  found,  that \\nhomogeneity  in  foci  is  positively  related  to \\nhomogeneity among friends online.\\n\\nThird,  we  hypothesized  and  corroborated \\nthat  as  network  size  increases,  larger  online \\nnetworks  are  characterized  by  lower  gender \\nhomogeneity, and that among ethnic minority \\ngroups, as online network size increases eth-\\nnic homogeneity decreases.\\n\\nOur  results  are  in  line  with  the  proposi-\\ntions that core ties are more segregated than \\nweaker ties (e.g., Blackwell and Lichter 2004; \\nGranovetter  1983;  Son  and  Lin  2012),  that \\n\\n\\x0c646   \\n\\nAmerican Sociological Review 82(3) \\n\\ndyadic similarity fosters tie strength because \\nreturns on investments are more likely (Leszc-\\nzensky  and  Pink  2015;  Windzio  and  Bicer \\n2013), and triadic closure is more pronounced \\namong  homogeneous  triads.  Personal  net-\\nworks initially mirror the features of meeting \\nopportunities, but over time, similar dyads are \\nmore \\nto  become  stronger  bonds, \\nwhereas  weak  ties  will  continue  to  reflect \\nfeatures  of  meeting  opportunities.  Ethnic \\nmajority members have limited opportunities \\nto  befriend  dissimilar  others,  as  reflected  in \\ncore and larger networks that are equally eth-\\nnically homogeneous.\\n\\nlikely \\n\\nLimitations of this Study\\n\\nFour  shortcomings  of  this  study  merit \\nacknowledgment.  First,  the  data  we  used \\nmight  not  be  perfectly  representative  of  the \\noverall  Dutch  adolescent  population,  due  to \\nattrition  rates  between  waves  (unit  non-\\nresponse)  and  selectivity  in  which  respon-\\ndents  are  more  likely  to  maintain  a  public \\nFacebook  friend  list  (item  non-response). \\nFuture  studies  might  utilize  representative \\nsamples  to  generalize  our  findings  to  entire \\nadolescent  populations,  to  other  age  groups, \\nand to other nations. However, when we esti-\\nmate  statistical  models  that  account  for  (at \\nleast some of ) this selectivity, we do not find \\nqualitatively different results than those pre-\\nsented  by  the  main  analyses,  nor  do  other \\nmodel  specifications  (e.g.,  fixed  effects  for \\nclasses or schools) lead to different results.\\n\\nSecond, predicting the ethnic background \\nof online network friends by their names with \\nour  machine-learning  algorithm  may  be  an \\nimperfect method, with the potential to mis-\\nclassify \\nindividuals’  ethnic  backgrounds. \\nMore  precise  measurements  of  ethnicity \\namong online network friends may be needed \\nto  establish  robust  evidence.  One  way  to \\naddress this issue is to collect the birthplace \\nof  friends  in  the  data  and  infer  their  ethnic \\nbackground from these birthplaces. Neverthe-\\nless,  there  is  a  strong  correlation  between \\nethnic background and names (Mateos, Long-\\nley,  and  O’Sullivan  2011),  and  we  find  evi-\\ndence  for  this  in  our  data,  especially  for \\n\\nrespondents of Dutch, Turkish, and Moroccan \\nbackgrounds.  Limiting  our  analyses  to  these \\ngroups did not alter our results.\\n\\nThird, one might argue that Facebook net-\\nworks  do  not  capture  respondents’  complete \\nnetworks.  There  may  be  selectivity  in  the \\nFacebook  friends  of  the  analyzed  respond-\\nents,  and  we  may  have  missed  something \\nspecific  to  these  friends.  For  instance,  indi-\\nviduals may add to their network contacts on \\nFacebook  only  others  with  whom  they  most \\nclosely  relate,  which  could  potentially  bias \\nthe results toward segregation. However, at a \\nmean  network  size  of  336,  we  have,  at  the \\nvery least, provided insight into a large por-\\ntion  of  the  complete  personal  network,  and \\nmost  certainly  a  larger  portion  of  networks \\nthan has previously been investigated, as fur-\\nther confirmed by studies on the overall size \\nof social networks (see note 2).\\n\\nFourth, our measurement of kin ties likely \\nhas measurement error. Kinship tags in online \\nnetworks can potentially lead to false positive \\nkin matches, as adolescents may tag non-kin \\nas kin. We partly solved this issue by consid-\\nering  realistic  tags  among  adolescents—that \\nis,  by  not  considering  granddaughters  or \\ngrandsons.  Nevertheless,  some  kin  tags  may \\nseem plausible (e.g., sibling tags) but are not \\nkin.  Despite  this  limitation,  we  believe  that \\nthe number of kin tags on Facebook is corre-\\nlated  to  the  number  of  real  family  members \\npresent among kin tags—that is, the number \\nof  accurate  kin  tags  exceeds  the  number  of \\nfictive kin tags. Some indication for this is the \\nnegative  correlation  between  the  number  of \\nkin  tags  and  gender  homogeneity  online. \\nHowever,  future  research  may  consider  the \\nstrategic use of fictive kinship tags in online \\nnetworks.  Additionally,  by  determining  kin \\nbased  on  shared  surnames  among  online \\nfriends, we may miss kin who have a different \\nsurname  than  the  respondent.  However,  the \\nnumber of friends sharing a respondent’s sur-\\nname  is  positively  correlated  to  ethnic  and \\ngender homogeneity on Facebook. This pro-\\nvides  some  evidence  that  this  variable  is  a \\ngood proxy for the relative amount of kin in \\nonline networks. Future research may consider \\nboth  parents’  surnames,  as  we  potentially \\n\\n\\x0cHofstra et al. \\n\\n647\\n\\nmiss kin ties to mothers’ families since chil-\\ndren  more  often  share  fathers’  surnames. \\nDespite these limitations, with our two meas-\\nurement  approaches  to  kin,  we  innovatively \\ncorrected for kinship ties in estimating segre-\\ngation in large online networks.\\n\\nImplications and Future Research\\n\\nOur study elaborates the work of DiPrete and \\ncolleagues  (2011),  one  of  the  few  studies  to \\ninvestigate  segregation  in  larger  networks. \\nDiPrete and colleagues used U.S. survey data, \\nwhereas  we  used  Facebook  data  from  Dutch \\nadolescents.  Despite  these  differences,  some \\nof  the  conclusions  and  intuitions  related  to \\nDiPrete and colleagues’ findings are upheld in \\nthis study; we found similar ethnic-racial seg-\\nregation in core networks and larger networks \\n(at  least  when  the  estimates  by  ethnic-racial \\ngroups  are  not  split).  DiPrete  and  colleagues \\n(2011:1271) speculated about its causes, stat-\\ning that meeting opportunities “do not play a \\nstrongly integrative role in contemporary . . . \\nsociety.” We aimed to use “imaginative strate-\\ngies . . . to determine the individual and struc-\\ntural factors that can explain heterogeneity in \\nsegregation across individuals” (DiPrete et al. \\n2011:1273).  Based  on  expectations  and  con-\\nsidering  the  relative  group  sizes  of  ethnic \\ngroups and both genders (Blau 1977a, 1977b), \\nand the segregated nature of foci (Feld 1981), \\nour study confirms that meeting opportunities \\npartially drive segregation among hundreds of \\ncontacts on Facebook.\\n\\nOur findings of different levels of segrega-\\ntion  between  core  networks  and  larger  net-\\nworks  (e.g.,  Blackwell  and  Lichter  2004; \\nGranovetter  1973,  1983;  Putnam  2000;  Son \\nand Lin 2012) seem to contrast with DiPrete \\nand  colleagues  (2011).  However,  when  we \\ntake into account the full range of tie-formation \\nmechanisms, \\nis  attenuated. \\nDiPrete and colleagues (2011) studied segre-\\ngation  along  religious,  political,  socioeco-\\nnomic, and racial lines—characteristics along \\nwhich  social  settings  segregate—and  conse-\\nquently  found  that  both  core  networks  and \\nlarger networks are segregated. However, we \\nfound  similarity  in  ethnic  segregation  only \\n\\nthe  contrast \\n\\namong core and weaker ties of ethnic major-\\nity members. We specifically found that eth-\\nnic minority members have far higher levels \\nof  homogeneity  among  their  core  networks \\nthan among their larger networks, and gender \\nhomogeneity  is  significantly  higher  among \\ncore  networks  than  among  larger  networks. \\nThis  finding  confirms  the  speculation  (e.g., \\nGranovetter 1973, 1983) that weaker ties are \\nless  segregated  than  core  ties,  but  it  also \\nexplains  the  findings  of  DiPrete  and  col-\\nleagues (2011). Moreover, disparities in seg-\\nregation  between  core  ties  and  weaker  ties \\noccur only under specific circumstances as a \\nconsequence of the interplay among meeting \\nopportunities, homophily, and balance.\\n\\nBecause our study uses data on adolescents, \\nwe should be careful in generalizing our results \\nto  a  broader  (adult)  population.  However,  the \\ntie-formation mechanisms we consider are not \\nunique to the adolescent population, and many \\nstudies show opportunity effects on segregation \\nin  other  target  populations  (e.g.,  Kalmijn  and \\nFlap 2001; Mollenhorst et al. 2008). Therefore, \\nwe conjecture that our results generalize to dif-\\nferent target populations, such as employees, as \\nthey  do  for  networks  measured  from  name \\ngenerators among employees (e.g., Feld 1982; \\nIbarra 1995). Nevertheless, it may be difficult \\nto  empirically  observe  the  patterns  we  found, \\ngiven that adolescents’ social contexts are well \\ndefined (see, e.g., Mollenhorst et al. 2008:62) \\nand that schools are a major focus of tie forma-\\ntion (Coleman 1961; McPherson et al. 2001).\\n\\nWe  acknowledge \\n\\nthat  cross-sectional \\nanalyses  cannot  be  used  to  establish  causal \\ndirection.  Nevertheless,  given  that  the  rela-\\ntionship between homogeneity in online net-\\nworks  and  opportunity  is  robust  (while \\ncontrolling for many confounders), we tenta-\\ntively  assume  that  similar  results  will  be \\nreplicated  using  longitudinal  data.  We  rec-\\nommend that future research considers segre-\\ngation  in  large  personal  networks  over  time \\nand settings as a next step to obtain potential \\ncausal estimates.\\n\\nAnother  area  for  future  research  is  feed-\\nback  effects:  What  are  the  effects  of  large \\npersonal  networks  online  vis-à-vis  core  net-\\nworks  offline?  Will  weak  ties  characterized \\n\\n\\x0c648   \\n\\nAmerican Sociological Review 82(3) \\n\\nby dyadic similarity turn into strong ties, and \\nwhat  online  behaviors  (e.g.,  Facebook  wall \\nposts)  will  lead  people  out  of  the  mode  of \\nsegregated large online networks?\\n\\nFinally,  future  research  may  examine \\nwhether the implications of core network seg-\\nregation, such as out-group attitude formation, \\n\\nresult  from  segregation  in  online  networks. \\nContact theory predicts that having more con-\\ntact with out-group members reduces prejudice \\ntoward  them  (Allport  1954;  Pettigrew  and \\nTropp 2006). Does this apply to the relation-\\nship between ethnic segregation in large online \\nnetworks (on Facebook) and ethnic prejudice?\\n\\nAppENdix\\n\\nFigure A1.

There  has  been  a  debate  on  the  increase  in  social \\nisolation (i.e., having zero alters to discuss “impor-\\ntant matters” with) of Americans between 1985 and \\n2004,  as  reported  by  McPherson  and  colleagues \\n(2006). A 2008 erratum (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, \\nand  Brashears  2008)  corrected  a  coding  error  in \\nthe  original  data  release.  In  2009  (Fischer  2009; \\nMcPherson,  Smith-Lovin,  and  Brashears  2009),  a \\ndiscussion emerged on whether the trend was a data \\nartifact  that  resulted  from  respondent  fatigue  and \\ntraining.  Paik  and  Sanchagrin  (2013)  showed  that \\nthe increase in social isolation may be attributed to \\nsubstantial interviewer effects.\\n\\n  2.   McCarty and colleagues (2001) found a mean total \\nnetwork size of 290; Hill and Dunbar (2003) found \\na size of 150; Zheng and colleagues (2006) found \\na  size  of  750;  McCormick,  Salganik,  and  Zheng \\n(2010)  found  a  size  of  611;  and  DiPrete  and  col-\\nleagues (2011) found a median network size of 550.\\n  3.   Balance  is  restored  in  this  network  configuration \\n(when A is friends with B, and A with C, then B and \\nC are likely to connect) under the assumption that \\nthese ties are positively signed, undirected, and of \\nthe same tie strength. For instance, a closed triad of \\nthree mutual foes is an unbalanced triad.\\n\\n  4.   One  can  apply  for  data  access  to  waves  1,  2, and \\n3  of  the  CILS4EU  via  the  following  link:  https://\\ndbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/sdesc2.asp?no=5353& \\ndb=e&doi=10.4232/cils4eu.5353.2.1.0.\\n\\n  5.   In  wave  1,  600  respondents  who  were  not  part  of \\nthe random sampling frame were sampled because \\nsome  schools  wanted  to  participate  in  the  survey \\nwith more than two classrooms. Therefore, a ran-\\ndom sample of 4,363 pupils was drawn in wave 1. \\nBecause of the attrition rates between waves 1 and \\n2, our sample is not necessarily representative. We \\nincluded  as  many  respondents  as  possible  in  the \\nsample  for  analyses,  including  newcomers  (non-\\nrandom) and the nonrandom sample of wave 1, to \\nensure a large sample size.\\n\\n  6.   An anonymized version of the DFS will be avail-\\nable in October 2017 (https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/\\ndatasets/id/easy-dataset:62379).\\n\\n  7.   We performed robustness analyses using Heckman \\nselection  models  (Heckman  1979).  Therefore,  we \\ncorrected  for  selectivity  in  modeling  an  outcome \\nonly when a second selection equation determined \\nthat  this  outcome  was  non-missing.  The  errors  of \\nboth  equations  are  allowed  to  correlate.  We  cor-\\nrect in the selection equation for ethnicity, gender, \\npopularity, and educational-track level. We cluster-\\ncorrected  standard  errors  for  the  class  cluster  and \\nschool cluster, because multilevel Heckman models \\nwere  computationally  infeasible.  These  analyses \\ndid not provide different results than those we present \\nhere. We present the analyses that consider the clus-\\ntered data. Tables are available upon request.\\n\\n  8.   The  combined  total  of  1,158,227  friends  is  a  raw \\ncount of all respondents’ friendships. Respondents \\nlikely have similar friends in their online networks. \\nCounting  the  unique  set  of  friends  would  most \\nlikely result in a lower number.\\n\\n  9.   The  collection  and  use  of  these  data  for  scientific \\npurposes  were  internally  approved  by  an  ethical \\nreview board for the social and behavioral sciences.\\n10.   We also assigned ethnicities based on name carri-\\ners’ last names, following the procedure outlined in \\nPart A of the online supplement. We obtained corre-\\nlations similar to those based on first names. We re-\\nperformed all analyses pertaining to ethnicity, and \\nthe results are robust when we consider last names.\\n11.   We  also  performed  all  of  our  descriptive  analyses \\nfor ethnicity with an index of qualitative variation \\n(IQV)—the  inverse  of  network  diversity  (Agresti \\nand Agresti 1977). The IQV for pupil i is formally \\ndefined as follows:\\n\\n−\\nIQV = 1 [\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8ed\\n\\nk\\n−\\n\\n1\\n\\nk\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\uf8f7 ∑\\n\\n(1\\n\\n−\\n\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n\\nb\\n\\n=1\\n\\n)]2\\n,\\np\\nb\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n          (3)\\nwhere k is the number of ethnic categories and pb is \\nthe fraction of Facebook friends in the bth category \\n(b =  1,…,  k). IQV has  been used in  various stud-\\nies to measure (ethnic) diversity in networks (e.g., \\nLewis et al. 2008; Marsden 1987; McPherson et al. \\n2006). In none of the analyses did the results differ \\nfrom those presented in the article.\\n\\n12.   In  removing  kin  from  the  Facebook  homogeneity \\nestimates,  we  assume  that  all  kin  are  of  a  similar \\n\\n\\x0c652   \\n\\nAmerican Sociological Review 82(3) \\n\\nethnic  background  as  the  respondent.  We  reduce \\nthe  number  of  co-ethnic  friends  and  the  number \\nof  Facebook  friends  by  the  number  of  identified \\nkin  ties  and  calculate  the  percentage  of  co-ethnic \\nfriends on Facebook. We assume that half the kin \\nties  are  of  similar  gender  as  the  respondent.  We \\nreduce the number of same-gender friends by half \\nthe number of identified kin and subtract the total \\nkin ties that are identified from the number of Face-\\nbook friends.\\n\\n13.   Indegree popularity can be formally defined as fol-\\n\\nlows:\\n\\n(\\n\\n∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n/B\\n\\nNji\\n\\n− ×1) 100,\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n                           (4)\\nwhere  i  is  the  actor,  Bji  indicates  whether  pupil  j \\nnominates pupil i as popular, and N is the total num-\\nber of pupils in a classroom.\\n\\n14.   We also controlled for dummy variables that indi-\\ncate  to  which  stratum  in  the  sampling  frame  the \\nrespondent belongs; thus, we account for some of \\nthe  selectivity  in  the  sampling  strategy.  In  none \\nof  the  analyses  does  this  control  variable  lead  to \\nqualitatively  different  results.  To  keep  the  results \\nparsimonious, we present the results without these \\nvariables.\\n\\n15.   We  furthermore  controlled  for  dummy  variables \\nthat indicate respondents’ generational immigration \\nstatus.  Categories  are,  for  instance,  Dutch  major-\\nity  adolescents  or  adolescents  who  have  only  one \\nforeign-born  grandparent.  Thus,  we  account  for \\ndifferences  in  immigration  background.  In  none \\nof  the  analyses  does  this  control  variable  lead  to \\nqualitatively  different  results.  To  keep  the  results \\nparsimonious, we present the results without these \\nvariables. For more information about generational \\nstatus in the CILS4EU data, see Dollmann, Jacob, \\nand Kalter (2014) and the CILS4EU Wave 2 Code-\\nbook (2016:273).\\n\\n16.   Pupils  from  the  same  class  may  look  more  alike \\nthan pupils from different classes, and the propor-\\ntion  of  variance  explained  at  the  class  and  school \\nlevels represents the expected correlation between \\ntwo randomly selected pupils within the same class. \\nThis is defined as follows:\\n\\nρs c\\n+\\n\\n=\\n\\nσ\\n\\n2\\ns\\n0\\n\\nk\\n\\nσ\\n\\n2\\ns\\nk\\n0\\nσ\\n+\\n\\n2\\nc\\n0\\n+\\n\\njk\\nσ\\n\\n+\\n\\nσ\\n\\n2\\nc\\n0\\n\\njk\\n\\n.\\n\\n2\\np\\n0\\n\\nijk\\n\\n \\n               (5)\\n17.   Pupils  from  the  same  school  may  resemble  each \\nother more than pupils from different schools, and \\nthe  expected  correlation  between  two  randomly \\nselected pupils from the same school is defined as \\nfollows:\\n\\nρs\\n\\n=\\n\\n \\n\\njk\\n\\nσ\\n\\n2\\nc\\n0\\n2\\nc\\n0\\n\\njk\\n\\nσ\\n\\n2\\ns\\n0\\n\\nk\\n\\n+\\n\\nσ\\n\\n.\\n\\n+\\n\\nσ\\n\\n2\\np\\n0\\n\\nijk\\n\\n                    (6)\\n\\n18.   We  estimated  similar  models  with  the  number  of \\nco-ethnic  and  same-gender  friendships  on  Face-\\nbook  and  offline  instead  of  percentages  as  depen-\\ndent  and  independent  variables  (we  controlled  for \\nnetwork sizes). We estimated random-effect models \\nwith either a random intercept at the class or school \\nlevel. We estimated fixed-effect models with dum-\\nmies for schools and classes. Finally, we estimated \\na model with only Dutch, Turkish, and Moroccans \\nbecause we could best predict these ethnicities. In \\nnone of these analyses did the results qualitatively \\ndiffer from the results presented here. Full tables are \\navailable upon request.\\n\\n19.   We performed additional robustness analyses to inves-\\ntigate whether our main results are driven by socially \\nisolated or highly connected adolescents on Facebook. \\nWe obtained similar results when we selected respon-\\ndents with more than 50 and fewer than 750 friends on \\nFacebook in our statistical models.\\n\\n20.   For Dutch majority members, we performed analy-\\nses considering the percentage of co-ethnic neigh-\\nborhood  residents  based  on  supplementary  data \\nfrom Statistics Netherlands. More co-ethnic neigh-\\nborhood  residents  positively  relate  to  the  percent-\\nage of co-ethnic friends on Facebook. We could not \\nperform similar analyses for ethnic minority mem-\\nbers, because these data do not distinguish between \\nthe presence of various ethnic minority groups in a \\nneighborhood.\\n\\n21.   Correlations  between  degree  and  individual  prop-\\nerties  may  happen  by  chance.  By  design,  there \\nmay be a negative correlation between degree and \\nindividual-level clustering in social networks. The \\nfriends of high-degree individuals are less likely to \\nbe linked than are friends of low-degree individuals \\n(Jackson 2008). We tested whether the correlation \\nbetween  homogeneity  and  degree  originates  from \\ndesign. We randomly rewired the ties of Facebook \\nnetworks while keeping individual degree constant; \\nwe found no correlations between degree and homo-\\ngeneity in this random mixing model. We therefore \\nassume that H0 is r(degree, homogeneity) = 0 (for \\nmore details, see Part B of the online supplement).\\n\\nReferences\\nAllport, Gordon W. 1954. The Nature of Prejudice.
