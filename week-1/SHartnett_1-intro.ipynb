It doesn't.\" On largely-conservative social media app Parler, messages posted by members contained chiefly hateful comments such as \"fags, can't stand gay people...should be illegal.\" Forbes has also reported Tarrio had posted opposing comments on Parler, describing how he believes \"the left was attempting to turn the group's name into 'a slur' and that the gay pride campaign with #proudboys was an attempt 'to drown out the voices of our supporters.'\"\n",

The emails warned: \"You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you.\" Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio denied the group's involvement and said he had spoken to the FBI about it. Tarrio told The Washington Post that \"[t]wo weeks ago I believe we had Google Cloud services drop us from their platform, so then we initiated a url transfer, which is still in process. We kind of just never used it.\" Miami New Times reported that the emails came from info@proudboysofficial.com, one of two websites belonging to the Proud Boys, and which Tarrio said had not been updated in a year and a half. Tarrio added that an authentic email from the Proud Boys would come from proudboysusa.com. The FBI announced that Iranian intelligence was responsible for the spoofed emails sent to intimidate Florida voters, and added that Russia was also working to influence the election.
